= Setting up environment variables

For the majority of the flags of the different commands available on Starkli we can define environment variables to make the commands shorter and easier to manage.

There are two primary environment variables that are vital for effective usage of Starkli's CLI. These are the location of the keystore file for the Signer, and the location of the Account Descriptor file.

Environment variables for these can be set as follows:

[source,bash]
----
export STARKNET_ACCOUNT=~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json
export STARKNET_KEYSTORE=~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/keystore.json
----

[NOTE]
====
The network does not need to be explicitly specified, given that the RPC provider is already configured for the testnet.

Setting environment variables for Starkli significantly simplifies command execution and management, thereby enhancing efficiency, readability, and control in your Starkli-related development activities.
