[id="validate_and_execute"]
= Account functions

The functions in the table xref:#starknet_account_interface_functions[] are part of account contracts. Where required, you must include these functions within your contract. The logic of these functions can be mostly arbitrary, with a few limitations. For information on these limitations, see xref:#invalid_transactions[].


[#starknet_account_interface_functions]
.Starknet account interface functions
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Function name | Description of minimal functionality

| `+__validate__+` | _Required_.

Initiates the validation stage in the sequencer. Validates the sender's address. The sequencer calls this function upon receiving an `INVOKE` transaction.

In most implementations, `+__validate__+` ensures that only the account owner can initiate transactions.

If the signature is verified, the method yields a `+'VALID'+` `+felt252+` value. If not, it returns 0.

| `+__execute__+` | _Required_.

Initiates the execution stage in the sequencer. The sequencer calls this function upon receiving an `INVOKE` transaction, after the `+__validate__+` function successfully completes.

In most implementations, `+__execute__+` initiates a sequence of calls from the account.
| `+__validate_declare__+` | _Required for a contract to be able to send a_`DECLARE` _transaction._

The sequencer calls this function upon receiving a `DECLARE` transaction. Validates the sender's address.

If the contract declares other contracts and handles the corresponding gas fees, this function authenticates the contract declaration.
| `+__validate_deploy__+`
| _Required when deploying an account with a_ `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` _transaction_.

The sequencer calls this function upon receiving a `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transaction. Validates the deployment of the class referred to by the `class_hash` parameter in the transaction.

You can use this function to set up an account contract without linking it to the address that deploys it or depending on another account contract for gas fees.
|===

When the sequencer receives a transaction request, it calls the corresponding validation function with the fields of the transaction request. For an `INVOKE` transaction, after successfully completing validation, the sequencer calls the `+__execute__+` function with the fields of the transaction request.

* For more information on the available transaction types and their fields, see xref:architecture_and_concepts:Network_Architecture/transactions.adoc[Transaction types].
* For more information on the validation and execution stages, see xref:architecture_and_concepts:Network_Architecture/transaction-life-cycle.adoc[Transaction lifecycle].

Separating the validation and execution stages guarantees payment to sequencers for work completed and protects them from Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

[id="the_validate_function"]
=== The `+__validate__+` function

#Does this apply to all validation functions?#

The `+__validate__+` function typically ensures that any transaction submitted was indeed initiated by the account owner and therefore does not take up unjustified resources during the execution process.

Without this mechanism, a forged transaction can result in the sequencer stealing the user's funds. So the `+__validate__+` function ensures that the sequencer can only include transactions that were approved by the account owner.

The arbitrary logic allowed in the `+__validate__+` function gives the account's designer the ability to determine what it means for a transaction to be valid, enabling different signature schemes and other xref:architecture_and_concepts:Accounts/introduction.adoc#examples[exotic accounts].

[id="invalid_transactions"]
== Invalid transactions

When the `+__validate__+`, `+__validate_deploy__+`, or `+__validate_declare__+`, function fails, the account in question does not pay any fee.

[#limitations_of_validation]
== Limitations of validation

The limitations listed here apply to the following validation functions:

* `+__validate__+`
* `+__validate_deploy__+`
* `+__validate_declare__+`
* A constructor, when run in a `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transaction. That is, if an account is deployed from an existing class via the `deploy` syscall, the constructor can run differently. #Isn't  this scenario run in an `INVOKE` transaction?#

The validation functions have the following limitations:

* You cannot call functions in external contracts, only in your account contract.
+
[NOTE]
====
This restriction enforces a single storage update being able to invalidate only transactions from a single account. However, be aware that an account can always invalidate its own past transactions by changing its keys.

So the fees you need to pay to invalidate transactions in the mempool are directly proportional to the number of unique accounts. For example, if the fee you need to pay to invalidate a transaction from one account is stem:[$$x$$], then the price of invalidating ten transactions from ten different accounts is stem:[$$10x$$].
====
* The maximum number of computational steps, measured in Cairo steps, for a validation function is 1,000,000.
* A builtin can be applied a limited number of times. #What's the limit?#
* Access is restricted to `+sequencer_address+` in the `+get_execution_info+` syscall. The syscall returns zero values for `+sequencer_address+`.
* Access is restricted to the following syscalls:
** `+get_block_hash+` for Cairo contracts
** `+get_sequencer_address+` for Cairo 0 contracts

[NOTE]
====
#Is this note obsolete?#

Validation, while now abstract and in control of the account owner rather than the protocol, should still be a simple operation. So in the future, the `+__validate__+` function will have a limitation of a maximum number of Cairo steps.

[#attacks_that_validation_limitations_prevent]
== Attacks that validation limitations prevent

The validation limitations prevent the following attacks:

* Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Without these limitations, an attack could cause the sequencer to perform a large amount of work before a transaction fails validation, such as by sending multiple, invalid `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transactions. This work would not be eligible for fee payment.
* Even if the validation is simple, the following attack could still be possible:
  . An attacker fills the mempool with transactions that are valid at the time they are sent.
  . A sequencer starts executing them, thinking that by the time it produces a block, they will still be valid.
  . However, shortly after the transactions are sent, the attacker sends one transaction that somehow invalidates all the previous ones and makes sure it's included in the block, by offering higher fees for this one transaction, before the sequencer can publish the block.
* Consider many validation functions checking that the value of a storage slot is `1`, and the attacker's transaction later sets it to `0`. To handle this issue, we add some further limitations. By restricting validation functions from calling external contracts, Starknet prevents this attack.

[id="the_execute_function"]
== The `+__execute__+` function

The purpose of the `+__execute__+` function is to abstract away the remaining actions performed by a transaction.

In Ethereum, a transaction is necessarily a call to a specific function in a smart contract. With the `+__execute__+` abstraction, the account designer controls the flow of the transaction. For example, multicalls can be natively supported in your account, saving the need to send multiple transactions (in practice, this is even harder to manage without multicalls due to nonces).

[id="reverted_transactions"]
== Reverted transactions

A transaction has the status *REVERTED* when the `+__execute__+` function fails. A reverted transaction is included in a block, and the sequencer is eligible to charge a fee for the work done up to the point of failure, similar to Ethereum.


======
This section is not appropriate, because the function can have arbitrary logic.

== `+__validate_deploy__+`

Validates a `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transaction.

[discrete]
=== Parameters

[horizontal,labelwidth="35",role="stripes-odd"]
`class_hash: _felt_`:: The class hash.
`contract_address_salt: _felt_`:: The contract address salt.
`<__constructor_arguments__>`:: The arguments expected by the contractâ€™s constructor. The compiler enforces this constructor.

[NOTE]
====
In determining the contract address, the deployer address `0x0` is used.
====

[discrete]
=== Example
Consider an account with the following constructor signature:

The signature of `+__validate_deploy__+` must be:

[#call_validate_deploy]
[source,cairo,sub="quotes"]
----
  fn __validate_deploy__(
      self: @ComponentState<TContractState>,
      class_hash: felt252,
      contract_address_salt: felt252,
      public_key: felt252
  ) -> felt252

#[constructor]
fn constructor(ref self: ContractState, public_key: felt252)
----

[NOTE]
====
You can access the transaction hash and value for `max_fee` with the `get_tx_info` system call.
