To enter a starknet command, use the following syntax: $ starknet Where: represents a single command that executes an operation on Starknet. represents zero or more command line options, each of which modifies the operation of the command. You need to set your Starknet network environment to use either testnet or Mainnet. You can set the environment using either a command-line option or an environment variable. Possible values are: alpha-goerli Sets the Starknet network to testnet alpha-mainnet Sets the Starknet network to Mainnet Setting the network environment using a command-line option When you enter any command, include the --network option. For example to use Mainnet, enter a command as follows: $ starknet --network alpha-mainnet You can place the --network option before or after any other option. Setting the network environment using an environment variable Set the STARKNET_NETWORK environment variable as follows: $ export STARKNET_NETWORK= For example, to use testnet, enter the following command: $ export STARKNET_NETWORK=alpha-goerli When working with the CLI, you can manually set the endpoints for the gateways that enable you to interact with Starknet, by including the following options: --feeder_gateway_url Sets the custom endpoint for read commands. --gateway_url Sets the custom endpoint for write commands. The following are the endpoints for Starknet testnet and Mainnet: Testnet feeder gateway URL: https://alpha4.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/ Mainnet feeder gateway URL: https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/ Testnet gateway URL: https://alpha4.starknet.io/gateway/ Mainnet gateway URL: https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io/gateway/ Example: Setting a custom read endpoint The following command returns the ABI using the Mainnet feeder gateway. $ starknet get_code --feeder_gateway_url https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/ Example: Setting a custom write endpoint The following command sends a transaction to the Starknet sequencer using the Mainnet gateway. $ starknet invoke --gateway_url https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io/gateway/ starknet call --address --abi --function --inputs --block_hash --block_number --signature --wallet --nonce Calls a Starknet contract without affecting the state, accepts the following arguments: contract_address* - address of the contract being called contract_abi* - a path to a JSON file that contains the abi of the contract being called function_name* - name of the function which is called arguments* - inputs to the function being called, represented by a list of space-delimited values block_hash - the hash of the block used as the context for the call operation.

Only used in the Alpha stages and will be deprecated in the future The deploy token is a temporary measure which will be deprecated when fees are incorporated in the system. Only relevant for Mainnet. starknet deploy_account --wallet --account Deploys an account contract, accepts the following arguments: account_name - the name given to the account, used for managing multiple accounts from the CLI (if not specified, the name __default__ is used. wallet_provider* - the path to module which manages the account (responsible for key generation, signing, etc.) Today, the Starknet CLI only works with the OpenZeppelin account contract. The CLI uses this specific wallet provider. To use this provider, either set up the following environment variable or pass the same value directly to the wallet_provider parameter: $ export STARKNET_WALLET=starkware.starknet.wallets.open_zeppelin.OpenZeppelinAccount Using the builtin wallet providers that are part of the cairo-lang package (starkware.starknet.wallets…​) is not secure (for example, the private key may be kept not encrypted and without backup in your home directory). You should only use them if you’re not overly concerned with losing access to your accounts (for example, for testing purposes). starknet estimate_fee --address --abi --function --inputs Returns the fee estimation for a given contract call. Accepts the following arguments: address* - the address of the contract being called contract_abi* - a path to a JSON file that contains the abi of the contract being called function_name*- the name of the function being called arguments* - inputs to the function being called, represented by a list of space-delimited values` starknet estimate_message_fee --from_address --to_address --function --inputs Returns the fee estimation for a given L1 handler application.

Deploying a smart contract in Starknet requires two steps: Declaring the class of your contract, i.e. sending your contract’s code to the network. Deploying a contract, i.e. creating an instance of the code you previously declared. If you require an example smart contract to test with, you can use a pre prepared example from the Starknet Book here. You can compile a smart contract using the Scarb compiler. To compile a smart contract, create a directory containing a Scarb.toml file and a subdirectory named src containing your contract source code. Add the following code to the Scarb.toml file: [package] name = \"contracts\" version = \"0.1.0\" [dependencies] starknet = \">=2.2.0\" [[target.starknet-contract]] sierra = true Navigate into the newly created directory: cd Run the following command: scarb build The compiled contract will be saved in the target/dev/ directory. The contract is now compiled and ready to be deployed. Next you will need to declare an RPC provider within your contract. To interact with the Starknet network, you need to set an RPC endpoint within Starkli. The following are the RPC providers available for Starknet: Provider name Description Infura or Alchemy Use a provider like Infura or Alchemy. Custom configuration Set up your own node and use the RPC provider of your node. More information on this can be found within the Starknet Book. For demonstration purposes, the Starknet Sequencer’s Gateway is used in the below steps. A contract can be declared on Starknet using the following command: starkli declare target/dev/.json --network=goerli-1 --compiler-version=2.1.0 The --network flag is used to specify the network you want to use, it could also be mainnet for example. The --compiler-version flag is used to specify the version of the compiler you want to use. Starkli is currently running on version 2.1.0 and 2.0.1 of the compiler. You can find the compiler version supported by Starkli by running: starkli declare --help In the --compiler-version flag you will see possible versions of the compiler: --compiler-version Statically-linked Sierra compiler version [possible values: 2.0.1, 2.1.0] However, the Scarb compiler version may be 2.2.0, you can find this out by running: scarb --version This is because Starkli and Scarb are not always in sync. In this case you would need to use the compiler version that Starkli is using by installing a previous version of Scarb. See the Scarb github repo for more detail. You can do this by running the following command for installing Scarb version 0.6.1: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh -s -- -v 0.6.1 If you were using a provider like Infura or Alchemy, the declaration command would look like this: starkli declare target/dev/contracts_Ownable.sierra.json \\ --rpc=https://starknet-goerli.infura.io/v3/ \\ --compiler-version=2.1.0 The result of the declaration command is a contract class hash: Class hash declared: This hash is the identifier of the contract class in Starknet. You can think of it as the address of the contract class. You can use a block explorer like StarkScan to see the contract class hash in the blockchain. If the contract you are declaring has previously been declared by someone else, you will get an output like this: Not declaring class as its already declared.

Starkli enables interaction with smart contracts via two primary methods: call for read-only functions. invoke for write functions that modify the state. The call command allows querying a smart contract function without sending a transaction. As an example you can use the get_owner function which doesn’t expect any arguments and returns the address of the current owner: starkli call \\ 0x014825acb37c36563d3b96c450afe363d2fdfa3cfbd618b323f95b68b55ebf7e \\ get_owner --network=goerli-1 This will return the address that we passed to the constructor during deployment: [ \"0x02cdab749380950e7a7c0deff5ea8edd716feb3a2952add4e5659655077b8510\" ] To modify the state of the smart contract, use the invoke command. Unlike the call command, invoke submits a transaction to the network. In this example, we’ll invoke the transfer_ownership function to transfer the ownership from our deployer address to a different smart wallet address: starkli invoke \\ 0x014825acb37c36563d3b96c450afe363d2fdfa3cfbd618b323f95b68b55ebf7e \\ transfer_ownership \\ 0x011088d3cbe4289bc6750ee3a9cf35e52f4fa4e0ac9f42fb0b62e983139e135a \\ --network=goerli-1 After the transaction is accepted on L2, you can confirm the state transition by calling the get_owner function again: starkli call \\ 0x014825acb37c36563d3b96c450afe363d2fdfa3cfbd618b323f95b68b55ebf7e \\ get_owner \\ --network=goerli-1 The get_owner function now returns the new owner address, confirming the successful ownership transfer.","title":"Interacting with a smart contract","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"interact_with_a_smart_contract","url":"/documentation/quick_start/interact_with_a_smart_contract/","titles":[{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Ensure Starkli and Scarb are installed correctly","hash":"ensure_starkli_and_scarb_are_installed_correctly","id":2},{"text":"Introduction","hash":"introduction","id":3},{"text":"Calling a function","hash":"calling_a_function","id":4},{"text":"Invoking a function","hash":"invoking_a_function","id":5}]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"This guide shows you how to set up a Starknet account and wallet in the context of a smart contract deployment. For information on creating a Starknet wallet as an end user, see Getting Started Using Starknet: Setting Up a Starknet Wallet. Ensure that the following commands show the version information for Starkli and Scarb: starkli --version scarb --version If either command fails, see Setting up your environment. Install a Starknet wallet via Argent X or Braavos. For information on a specific wallet, including installation instructions, see that wallet’s site. A smart wallet is composed of two parts: A Signer: A smart contract that can sign transactions. An Account Descriptor: A json file that contains information about the smart wallet, such as its address and public key. After creating and funding your smart wallet with ETH you can deploy it to Starknet. For demonstration purposes, this page uses Starknet’s testnet. For testnet transactions you can fund your wallet using the Starknet Goerli Faucet. A Signer is a smart contract that can sign transactions. It’s a crucial component of accounts in Starknet. To create a Signer you will need the private key of your smart wallet (the public key can be derived from it). Starkli has the ability to create a keystore file that securely stores the private key of smart wallets each with a password. The accounts in the keystore file can be used to sign transactions using Starkli. The main advantage of this approach is that it prevents storing the private key as plain text on your computer. Instead, a password is used to create an encrypted file in a location of choice. Normally, the keystore file is stored in the default location of the Starkli CLI. The following command creates a keystore file for a smart wallet in the default location in ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer: Create a new directory: mkdir ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer Create a keystore file within the directory: starkli signer keystore from-key ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/keystore.json Enter private key: Enter password: Created new encrypted keystore file: /home/parallels/.starkli-wallets/deployer/keystore.json Public key: 0x0550… In the private key prompt, paste the private key of your smart wallet. In the password prompt, enter a password of your choice. You will need this password to sign transactions using Starkli. Next export the private key from your Argent X or Braavos wallet: Navigate to: Settings section → Select your Account → Export Private Key. Navigate to: Settings section → Privacy and Security → Export Private Key. While knowing the private key of a smart wallet is necessary to sign transactions, it’s not sufficient. We also need to inform Starkli about the signing mechanism employed by our smart wallet created by Argent X or Braavos. Starkli offers a command to collect all the required information from a smart wallet by providing its onchain address. Using this data, the CLI generates a json file that can be used to sign transactions: starkli account fetch --help Fetch account config from an already deployed account contract The fetch command supports both Argent X and Braavos smart wallets. Make sure your wallet address is already deployed and input following command to create and save the account descriptor file: starkli account fetch --output ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json The following command shows the details of the account descriptor: cat ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json The account descriptor should have the following structure: { \"version\": 1, \"variant\": { \"type\": \"argent\", \"version\": 1, \"implementation\": \"\", \"signer\": \"\", \"guardian\": \"0x0\" }, \"deployment\": { \"status\": \"deployed\", \"class_hash\": \"\", \"address\": \"\" } } If you are working with Braavos wallet, the type is defined as braavos and the account descriptor structure might be slightly different. Once you have an account file, you can deploy the account contract with the starkli account deploy command. This command sends a DEPLOY_ACCOUNT transaction, which requires the account to be funded with some ETH for paying for the transaction fee. To deploy your account, run the following command: starkli account deploy ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json This command requires a signer. If you receive an error after running this command, ensure you have the STARKNET_KEYSTORE environment variable set as per these instructions. When run, the command shows: The address where the contract will be deployed. Instructions for the user to fund the account before proceeding. Here’s an example command output: The estimated account deployment fee is 0.000011483579723913 ETH. However, to avoid failure, fund at least: 0.000017225369585869 ETH to the following address: 0x01cf4d57ba01109f018dec3ea079a38fc08b789e03de4df937ddb9e8a0ff853a Press [ENTER] once youve funded the address.

Juno Console Enhancement: Pretty printing of Juno console logs for an enriched user experience. Comprehensive Documentation: Official documentation now hosted on GitHub Pages. RPC Schema Consistency: Revised to ensure our RPC schema is consistent with the Starknet specification. Command-line switches have been restructured to provide clearer access control: docker run -d --name juno -p $httpPort:$httpPort -p $metricsPort:$metricsPort -v /root/juno:/var/lib/juno nethermind/juno:v0.6.0 --db-path /var/lib/juno --http --http-port $httpPort --metrics --metrics-port $metricsPort --eth-node (Note: Ensure to adjust the variables like $httpPort, $metricsPort and others as per your configuration.) Database Migration: This version introduces database changes due to our work focus on peer-to-peer (p2p) communication. These changes may result in extended migration times. For faster sync, we recommend users to utilize snapshots. This release adds support for the Starknet v0.12.2. Support for Starknet v0.12.2 This release adds support for the upcoming Starknet v0.12.1 upgrade and includes compatibility with v0.4.0 of the RPC specification.

Since this release is required for v0.11.1, you should update your node before the network is updated. Starknet v0.11.1 support CORS support via the rpc.cors-domains configuration option Transaction hashes are now verified as part of the sync process. Previously, these were not verified as the exact algorithm was underdocumented and the transaction format was still evolving. RPC server panic for unprefixed unregistered method names Data can temporarily appear to go missing when transitioning from PENDING to ACCEPTED ON L2 This was commonly seen when rapidly monitoring a new transaction, which would go from PENDING to TXN_HASH_NOT_FOUND to ACCEPTED_ON_L2 as pathfinder moved the ephemeral pending data to latest data on disk. Fixes for minor issues and inconsistencies. max-rpc-connections command-line argument. This sets the maximum number incoming RPC connections the pathfinder node will accept. This defaults to 1024 if not specified. cairo-lang upgraded to 0.11.0.2 starknet_simulateTransaction data model inconsistency poll-pending default value restored to false incoming RPC connections limited to 100. This limit was accidentily introduced in v0.5.2 as part of a dependency upgrade, whereas before it was unlimited. The default is now 1024 and can be configured using --max-rpc-connections. handling of invalid JSON-RPC requests This release fixes a few RPC bugs and adds support for bulk fee estimation and transaction simulation (traces) as part of v0.3 RPC specification. In addition it also adds a pathfinder_getTransactionStatus endpoint which lets you track a transactions status — including REJECTED and RECEIVED — in the same fashion as the gateway. support starknet_estimateFee in the JSON-RPC v0.3 API supports estimating multiple transactions this includes declaring and immediately using a class (not currently possible via the gateway) support starknet_simulateTransaction for JSON-RPC v0.3 supports simulating multiple transactions this includes declaring and immediately using a class (not currently possible via the gateway) support pathfinder_getTransactionStatus which is exposed on all RPC routes this enables querying a transactions current status, including whether the gateway has received or rejected it RPC returns int for entrypoint offsets instead of hex RPC rejects Fee values with more than 32 digits RPC does not expose pathfinder_getProof on v0.3 route This is a minor bugfix release, primarily to fix an issue with syncing on testnet2. pathfinder sometimes spams nethermind L1 nodes pathfinder stops syncing testnet2 at block 95220 due to a Sierra class compilation issue starknet v0.11.0 support RPC API v0.3 partial support removed several deprecated config options requires python 3.9 or 3.10 (no longer 3.8) support for state commitment and class commitment in pathfinder_getProof support for starknet v0.11 partial support for RPC specification v0.3 exposed on /rpc/v0.3/ route missing support for starknet_estimateFee and starknet_simulate starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee JSON-RPC methods return more detailed error messages python version requirement has changed to 3.9 or 3.10 (was 3.8 or 3.9 previously) RPC accepts hex inputs for Felt without '0x' prefix. This led to confusion especially when passing in a decimal string which would get silently interpretted as hex. using a Nethermind Ethereum endpoint occasionally causes errors such as could not be found to be logged. sync can miss new block events by getting stuck waiting for pending data. --config configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1)) --integration configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1)) --sequencer-url configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1)) --testnet2 configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1)) starknet_addDeployTransaction as this is no longer an allowed transaction since starknet v0.10.3 RPC api version 0.1, which used to be served on path /rpc/v0.1 We added support for v0.3 and removed v0.1. We still support v0.2 at both /rpc/v0.2 and /rpc (default) routes. In summary: / # serves v0.2 /rpc/v0.2/ # serves v0.2 /rpc/v0.3/ # serves v0.3 We are missing starknet_estimateFee and starknet_simulate support for v0.3, which will be added in an upcoming release. Note: this only applies if you are building from source. This does not impact docker users. Pathfinder requires python to support the starknet VM used to simulate starknet transactions and function calls. Previous versions of the VM only worked with python 3.8 or 3.9 which was a hassle because most operating systems no longer directly support it. The new version of the VM bundled with starknet v0.11 now requires python version 3.9 or 3.10. Several configuration options are now removed, after they were deprecated in pathfinder v0.4.1. Here is a migration guide: --testnet2: use --network testnet2 instead --integration: use --network integration instead --sequencer-url: use --network custom in combination with --feeder-gateway-url and gateway-url --config: use environment variables or env files as an alternative Hotfix for a bug introduced in the previous version v0.4.4, which prevented a new node from syncing on blocks near genesis. Added Newton FAQ links to readme Node fails to sync old blocks @SecurityQQ made their first contribution in #799 This minor release contains some nice performance improvements for starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee as well as some minor bug fixes. Also included is a major new feature: storage proofs - big thanks @pscott for his hard work on this feature! This is available via the pathfinder_getProof method which is served from both the pathfinder and Starknet endpoints for convenience: /rpc/pathfinder/v0.1/pathfinder_getProof /rpc/v0.2/pathfinder_getProof The method is specified here. Its results can be used to formally verify what a contract’s storage values are without trusting the pathfinder node. This is achieved by validating the merkle-proof that pathfinder returns and confirming that it correctly matches the known Starknet state root. storage proofs via pathfinder_getProof by @pscott starknet_getEvents returns all events when from_block=\"latest\" v0.1 starknet_getStateUpdate does not contain nonces Improved performance for starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee by caching classes Improved performance for starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee by using Rust for hashing @pscott made their first contribution in #726 The primary purpose of this release is to properly support testnet2 after the Starknet v0.10.3 update. The v0.10.3 update changed the testnet2 chain ID which impacts transaction signatures which in turn meant that starknet_estimateFee would fail for any signed transaction. This release updates pathfinder to use the correct chain ID. Testnet2 and integration flags are ignored starknet_estimateFee uses wrong chain ID for testnet2 Updated to cairo-lang 0.10.3 Contains several bug fixes, mostly hotfixes for bugs introduced in v0.4.1. Document that --chain-id expects text as input Testnet2 and integration L1 addresses are swapped (bug introduced in v0.4.1) Proxy network setups can’t sync historical blocks (bug introduced in v0.4.1) ABI serialization for starknet_estimateFee for declare transactions Soft deprecation of some configuration options Support custom Starknet gateways Pathfinder RPC extensions at /rpc/pathfinder/ with pathfinder_version method starknet_events optimisations fix block timestamp in pending calls Custom Starknet gateway support This release introduces support for custom Starknets. You can select this network by setting --network custom and specifying the --gateway-url and --feeder-gateway-url options. Several configuration options have been soft deprecated. This means using them will continue to work as before (no breaking change), but they will emit a warning when used. They will be removed in a future version, so please migrate to the newer options. To re-emphasize: your current configuration setup will continue to work as is. --testnet2 and --integration have been deprecated in favor of --network testnet2 and --network integration. --sequencer-url has been deprecated in favor of --network custom along with --gateway-url, --feeder-gateway-url and --chain-id. In addition, you will need to rename your existing database file to custom.sqlite as this will be the expected filename for custom networks. --config has been deprecated and will not be supported in the future. The utility this provided was valuable. Unfortunately it is starting to severely hinder how fast we can implement configuration changes and we decided to remove it. We suggest using environment variables along with environment files to configure pathfinder in a similar fashion. The following configuration options are now marked as deprecated: --testnet2, --integration, --config, --sequencer-url Optimized starknet_events for queries with both a block range and a from address Block timestamps for pending in starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee were using the latest timestamp instead of the pending one. This meant contracts relying on accurate timestamps could sometimes fail unexpectedly. Custom Starknet support Pathfinder specific RPC extensions hosted at /rpc/pathfinder/v0.1. Currently, this only contains pathfinder_version which returns the pathfinder version of the node. This release contains a breaking change, and also adds support for Starknet v0.10.2. The changes themselves are quite simple, but please read through each section as there are some caveats which might impact you when you apply this update. This release changes the version of the RPC that is served at the root route, from v0.1 to v0.2 of the RPC specification. Version v0.1 is still available at the /rpc/v0.1/ endpoint. This is the only breaking change in this release. Here is a summary of what routes are currently available, and what’s changed: / serves v0.2 (changed from v0.1) /rpc/v0.1 serves v0.1 (no change) /rpc/v0.2 serves v0.2 (no change) If possible, we recommend that you use the version specific routes as this will prevent such breaking changes from impacting you. This release includes an update to the cairo-vm embedded in pathfinder in order to support the upcoming v0.10.2 Starknet release. This bundled vm is a pre-release and may therefore contain differences to the final version used once Starknet updates testnet and mainnet. We will of course issue a new release if / when there is a new vm. Since these changes are not yet live on testnet nor mainnet, this means upgrading to this release will cause deviations between what pathfinder outputs and what can be expected on the network. More specifically, starknet_estimateFee will compute different fees until the network has upgraded to Starknet v0.10.2. If you don’t need the RPC route changes, it may be pertinent to delay updating until closer to the v0.10.2 release dates on testnet and mainnet.

It was meant to be used as a temporary solution until full nodes that support Starknet’s JSON-RPC mature and are able to meet the needs of the community. Starknet now has three different full node implementations in production (Pathfinder, Juno, and Papyrus). Consequently, it is time to deprecate the feeder gateway and migrate to RPC providers. For more information, see the Community Forum post Feeder Gateway Deprecation. The feeder gateway will stop supporting most queries on the following dates: Environment Date Integration 1st November 2023 Testnets 15th November 2023 Mainnet 11th December 2023 The feeder gateway will continue to support queries required for full nodes to synchronize on the state of Starknet.","title":"Upcoming Starknet versions","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"upcoming_versions","url":"/documentation/starknet_versions/upcoming_versions/","titles":[{"text":"Starknet Alpha v0.12.3","hash":"starknet_alpha_v0_12_3","id":1},{"text":"What to expect","hash":"what_to_expect","id":2},{"text":"Key dates","hash":"key_dates","id":3}]},"14":{"id":14,"text":"The following release notes cover the ongoing version changes to Starknet. To get the latest version updates delivered to your inbox, please subscribe to our mailing list. Within Starknet’s deployment pipeline there are separate and distinct networks that operate independently of each other for testing before deployment. Goerli testnet 2 is removed. Use Goerli testnet. Table 1. Current versions supported in each environment Environment Starknet version Sierra version Cairo version Mainnet 0.12.2 1.3.0 2.0.0 - 2.3.0 Goerli Testnet 0.12.2 1.3.0 2.0.0 - 2.3.1 Starknet v0.12.2 is live on Mainnet. This version includes the following changes: Enabling P2P Authentication: An additional endpoint in the sequencer gateway to provide a signature on the state diff commitment and block hash. Resolving Mismatches in Queries: An extension to the get_state_update endpoint in the sequencer gateway that returns both the pending state diff and the pending block together. Increased maximum Cairo steps per transaction from 1 million to 3 million. Starknet v0.12.1 is live on Mainnet. This version includes the following changes: Mempool Validation. Inclusion of Failed Transactions. Keccak builtin. Starknet v0.12.0 is live on Mainnet. This version contains the following changes: Use the rust blockifier and LambdaClass’s Cairo VM to accelerate the sequencer’s time to handle transactions. Support version 2.0.0 of the Cairo compiler. Replace the PENDING status of transactions to ACCEPTED_ON_L2 - once a transaction is in that status it means that it will be included in a block, this applies to transactions - blocks still have the PENDING status. Add an experimental get_block_hash syscall. Change HTTP error code from 500 to 400 on API errors. Starknet v0.11.2 is live on Mainnet. This version contains the following changes: Upgrade Cairo 1.0 version to v1.0.0-rc0 (Cairo 1.0 activated on Starknet!) Starknet v0.11.1 is live on Mainnet. This version contains the following changes: Upgrade Cairo 1.0 version to v1.0.0-rc0. Charged transaction fee is now based on an average Ethereum gas price instead of a single sample (estimation API is unaffected). API changes: Remove the state root in get_state_update for pending blocks to allow faster responses in future versions. Testing framework: Allow declaring (and interacting with) Cairo 1.0 contracts. Currently, the Cairo 1.0 ABI is not supported yet, so a Cairo 0 ABI should be supplied to declare() manually. Split deploy() to two phases declare and deploy: deprecated_declare() (for Cairo 0 contract) or declare() (for Cairo 1.0 contracts) and deploy() (for both). Add current block hash to the Starknet Core contract (currently not verified by the Starknet OS): Breaking change: The LogStateUpdate event’s data is changed to include blockHash. Starknet v0.11.0 is live on Mainnet. invoke and declare transactions of version 0 are no longer supported on this version. In Starknet v0.11.0, you can declare, deploy and run Cairo 1.0 smart contracts. We also introduce a new system call that allows a smooth transitioning of existing contracts to a Cairo 1.0 implementation. Historically, contract classes have been defined in terms of Cairo assembly, or Casm for short (the class definition also included more information needed for execution, e.g., hint data). The novelty of Cairo 1.0 is the introduction of Sierra (Safe Intermediate Representation), an intermediate layer between Cairo 1.0 and Casm. The introduction of Cairo 1.0 and Sierra has several effects on the system. Below we list the effects on each component; of particular note are: A new version of the declare transaction, which allows sending the new class structure The state commitment will now include contract classes Changes to the onchain data format New system call - replace_class The deploy transaction is no longer supported on this version. This version contains the following changes: Starknet Performance - Separate the state commitment computation from the execution of the transactions Add starknet-class-hash command to compute the class hash of a compiled Starknet contract Cairo: Autoformatter: Automatically break lines inside expressions This version introduces sequencer parallelization! This is the first step in our roadmap of performance upgrades. Details about the specific mechanism of parallelization and the roadmap in general are described in this medium post. A new endpoint, estimate_fee_bulk, is added to the feeder gateway. This will allow estimating the fee of several transactions at once, where each transaction is executed relative to the resulting state from applying the previous one. Sequencing performance improvements Builtin ratio changes, which affects builtin costs Add estimate_fee_bulk API that computes the fee of multiple transactions that will be executed consecutively As part of this version, we will also increase the finality of transactions in the pending block, by fixing the timestamp at the time of the block creation. This will solve the issue of transactions moving from pending to rejected on account of too old timestamp This version contains the following changes: Starknet: Add DeployAccount transaction (which will replace the Deploy transaction for deploying account contracts). To use it, you should first add enough funds to your account address to pay the transaction fee, and then you can invoke DeployAccount Split the starknet deploy_account CLI command into starknet new_account and starknet deploy_account Account contracts that are expected to be deployed this way should implement the`validate_deploy()` entry point, which should check the signature of the DeployAccount transaction Improve L1 fee computation: the fee is computed according to the diff of the storage state API: Remove entry_point_type field from transaction information Cairo: Add uint256_mul_div_mod to uint256.cairo This version introduces the next step in Starknet’s account abstraction design, specifically the validate/execute separation. See here for more information. This version contains the following changes: Starknet: Contract (breaking changes): @external and @view functions should be imported directly by the main compiled file. Otherwise, they will not be usable as external functions Forbid using the same storage variable name in two modules New transaction version (version 1) for invoke and declare transactions: Transactions of version 0 are deprecated and will not be supported in Starknet from the next version (v0.11.0). Please update your systems to use the new version In order to use transactions of version 1 you will need to upgrade your account contracts Add nonce field to the transactions. Nonce validation is now part of the Starknet protocol and is enforced to be executed sequentially Invoke: Split execute to two functions:` validate` (only validates the transaction) and execute (only executes the transaction) Remove the selector (which is now always execute) field, following the above change. Declare: declare transaction should now be sent from an account (and is validated using validate_declare in the account contract) Support fee for sending L1 messages. At this point, it’s not mandatory and messages with no fee will still be handled. Starting from the next version it will become mandatory. Cairo: Syntax changes in Cairo (to make it more similar to rust and C++): You can use the cairo-migrate script to convert old code to the new syntax. Use the -i flag to apply the changes to the files End statements with ; New lines are still part of the language at this point, and you cannot put more than one instruction per line. This will change in Cairo1.0. Use { … } for code blocks (instead of : and end) Add () around the condition of if statements Remove the member keyword in structs Change comment to use // instead of # Use …​, ap` instead of `...; ap in low level Cairo code Support return types that are not tuples. For example, func foo() → felt (instead of func foo() → (r: felt)) As a result, it’s now mandatory to specify return types. func foo() → (res) should be replaced by func foo() → (res: felt). The cairo-migrate tool does that automatically. Return statement accepts expressions, rather than only tuples. For example, you can write let x = (5,); return x; A few standard library functions were changed to return felt. The cairo-migrate script also fixes calls to those functions Support using functions as expressions This only applies to functions with → felt signature`, whose ap change is known at compile-time (e.g., recursive functions cannot be used this way) Fix a bug in the secp signature verification code that allowed a malicious prover to ignore the value of v (this does not let the prover fake a signature, but allows it to claim that a valid signature is invalid). Add Cairo code for the recursive STARK verifier Technical changes: * Move from python3.7 to python3.9 This version contains the following changes: Starknet: API changes: Add get_block_traces API - returns all the transaction traces of a given block Add a list of declared contracts in get_state_update Add a 0x prefix for class hash in the API Add starknet_version field for blocks (only applies to new blocks) Starknet CLI: Change the default block number to pending Using a wallet is the default, --no_wallet must be specified explicitly to override this Deploying contracts: Add deploy_contract function to the account contract created by starknet deploy_account Use this function to deploy contract (unless using --no_wallet). In particular, deploy should be used after declaring the contract (it expects the contract class hash) Support --dry_run to get the transaction information without signing or sending it Support deploy_from_zero in the deploy syscall to deploy a contract to an address that does not depend on the deployer Cairo: * Support and in if statements (if x == y and z == w). At the moment other boolean combinations are not supported This version introduces the contract class/instance paradigm into Starknet. See here for more information. This version contains the following changes: Starknet: Enforce fees - max_fee must not be set to zero, and selector must be execute Split the concepts of contract class and contract instance. Add declare transaction type New API and CLI commands: declare - Declares a contract class get_class_by_hash - Returns the contract class given its hash get_class_hash_at - Returns the class hash for a given contract instance address Rename delegate_call to library_call, and change the contract address argument to class hash. Add a deploy system call. Rename ContractDefinition to ContractClass Reduce the compiled contract file’s size by removing unnecessary identifiers (this optimization can be disabled using --dont_filter_identifiers) Cairo: Initial support for the EC-op builtin (scalar multiplication over the STARK curve). Not supported in Starknet yet. Add additional helper methods to blake2s.cairo, including big-endian support Technical changes: * Change function’s return type from a struct to a named tuple. In particular, foo.Return.SIZE is no longer supported.","title":"Starknet release notes","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"version_notes","url":"/documentation/starknet_versions/version_notes/","titles":[{"text":"Starknet environments","hash":"starknet_environments","id":1},{"text":"Starknet v0.12.2 (September 4th 23)","hash":"version0.12.2","id":2},{"text":"Starknet v0.12.1 (August 21st 23)","hash":"version0.12.1","id":3},{"text":"Starknet v0.12.0 (July 12th, 23)","hash":"version0.12.0","id":4},{"text":"Starknet v0.11.2 (May 31, 23)","hash":"version0.11.2","id":5},{"text":"Starknet v0.11.1 (May 23, 23)","hash":"version0.11.1","id":6},{"text":"Starknet v0.11.0 (Mar 29, 23)","hash":"version0.11.0","id":7},{"text":"Starknet v0.10.3 (Dec 12, 22)","hash":"version0.10.3","id":8},{"text":"Starknet v0.10.2 (Nov 29, 22)","hash":"version0.10.2","id":9},{"text":"Starknet v0.10.1 (Oct 25, 22)","hash":"version0.10.1","id":10},{"text":"Starknet v0.10.0 (Sept 05, 22)","hash":"version0.10.0","id":11},{"text":"Starknet v0.9.1 (July 20, 22)","hash":"version0.9.1","id":12},{"text":"Starknet v0.9.0 (June 06, 22)","hash":"version0.9.0","id":13}]},"15":{"id":15,"text":"A list of recommended full-nodes, open API endpoints, and API providers.

The tools discussed here are being developed in coordination with StarkWare, and in some cases have received grants from StarkWare or the Starknet Foundation in order to make the development process as friendly as possible, with improvements happening all the time. While originally the stack of Starknet development tools was based mostly on Python, tool developers are moving towards building with Rust. See the table Tools for each stage of development below to understand where each tool fits in the development process. Table 1.

Starkli, pronounced Stark-lie, is a fast command-line interface that replaces the legacy starknet-CLI. Starkli is a standalone interface, that is, you can use it on its own, rather than as a component of another tool. If you’re not actually developing on Starknet and just want to interact, such as by sending transactions, then a standalone CLI might be more appropriate than an interface such as Cast, which is an integrated component of the Foundry development environment. Starknet community contributor Jonathan Lei, the co-founder and CTO of zkLend. Starkli is a Starknet CLI similar to cairo-lang but written in Rust. It’s easier to install and to navigate, and has no dependencies. The tool supports Braavos and Argent X smart wallets, and has embedded support for RPC endpoints. Starkli includes standard CLI functionality, such as the following: Deploying accounts. Interacting with contracts. Getting Starknet data, such as information about blocks, transactions, and more. Starkli also includes the following features: Compute class hashes from the Cairo file that defines the class. Compute a function’s selector. Encode messages. Auto-completion. Useful help commands. The ability to make multi-calls. Starkli: The New Starknet CLI, on Medium, includes information on getting started, including installation instructions. The Starkli Github repository The Starkli Book A Software Development Kit (SDK) is a library that abstracts the complexities of Starknet when building transactions and interacting with the blockchain, including the following: Read and write API calls, using both the JSON-RPC and the Feeder gateway API. Account creation. Cryptography: Signature verification and signing, computing hashes used by Starknet. Contract interactions: ABI import, constructing transactions. There are several SDKs for various languages, so you can choose the SDK according to your preferred language.

Shardlabs originally wrote starknet-devnet in Python, but they are now actively developing a version in Rust, starknet-devnet-rs. For now, the Python-based version is more feature-rich, with the most notable feature being the ability to fork the network at a given block, so if that’s important to you, then you need to use the Python-based version. However, starknet-devnet-rs runs more quickly, and the developers are working to bring it to feature parity with the Python-based starknet-devnet. starknet-devnet-rs is the only version that is receiving new features. Shardlabs starknet-devnet and starknet-devnet-rs include some accounts that are already funded with an ERC-20 token that can be used to pay fees. The ERC-20 contract that defines this token is also included. With starknet-devnet and starknet-devnet-rs You can do the following: Create mock accounts. Send transactions using pre-deployed, pre-funded accounts, which are included. Test tools. Test RPC requests. Deploy new contracts using an included Universal Deployer Contract (UDC). The starknet-devnet Gitbhub repository The starknet-devnet-rs Github repository Katana, developed by the Dojo team, is an extremely fast devnet designed to support local development with Dojo, which is a gaming engine for Starknet. You can use Katana as a general purpose devnet as well. Katana lets developers test applications locally using the Katana network to test the transactions being sent during the game. Katana provides convenient RPC methods that you can use to change the network’s configuration as needed. For example, you can change the block time or allow zero-fee transactions. Katana supports version v0.3.0 of the Starknet JSON-RPC specifications, the latest version as of June 2023. Katana lets you use native Starknet JSON calls, such as starknet_getTransactionReceipt, starknet_getStorageAt. Katana in the Dojo documentation includes information on installing and using Katana. The official package manager for Starknet. Software Mansion It makes life easier in the following ways: When installing Cairo packages, it handles adding, updating, and removing dependencies. You can use it to compile smart contracts. When creating your own Cairo package, it takes care of patching any libraries you need from Github, and lets you know if there’s a version mismatch. You can then use it to build and test your project, using the Cairo test runner. Building is quite fast. It includes the Cairo compiler, built-in, so unless you’re actually a compiler developer, you don’t need to set up any extra tooling. It includes a bundled binary of the Cairo language server, which you can use It works well with other tools in the Cairo ecosystem, such as Foundry and Dojo. The Scarb site Starknet Foundry is a toolchain for developing Starknet smart contracts. It helps with writing, deploying, and testing your smart contracts. Software Mansion Starknet Foundry includes the following features: Forge, a fast testing framework. Forge achieves performance comparable to the Cairo Test Runner with a better user experience. You can test standalone functions in your smart contracts and embed complex deployment flows. Support for prints in contracts. According to the documentation, the debugging features will follow the addition of support in the Starknet compiler. The online Foundry Book, with lots of helpful information and guidance in writing and running tests and interacting with Starknet. Integrated compiling and dependency management, using Scarb. Cast, which the documentation refers to by its command name, sncast. Cast is an integrated CLI specifically designed for performing Starknet RPC calls, sending transactions and getting Starknet chain data. You can use Cast to declare, deploy, and interact with contracts using the Starknet JSON-RPC. The Starknet Foundry Github repo A tool primarily for testing Cairo code. You can also deploy contracts using scripts in JavaScript. Shardlabs Hardhat is a popular JavaScript development environment for Ethereum, and if you are already familiar with it and want to use it on Starknet, then this plugin can come in handy. You can run Starknet commands as tasks in Hardhat, such as compiling a Cairo contract. Hardhat is integrated with a local devnet, so you only need to worry about writing your tests, in JavaScript, of course. Get Hardhat at the Hardhat site. Get the Starknet plugin at the Starknet Hardhat plugin Github repo. See examples of how to use the plugin at the Starknet Hardhat example scripts Github repo. Remix is a browser-based integrated development environment (IDE) for Ethereum that you can use for learning, experimenting and finding vulnerabilities in smart contracts, without installing anything. The Starknet Remix plugin lets you use Remix for testing Starknet smart contracts, so you can focus on learning Cairo and Starknet without the distraction of setting up a toolchain. Nethermind Remix and the Starknet Remix plugin include the following features: Integrated compiling. You can deploy contracts on any devnet, including the plugin’s own integrated devnet. You can also deploy on testnet or Mainnet. You can call functions of contracts that you have already deployed, to facilitate testing and interaction. Seamless integration with Scarb. Integration with block explorers such as Voyager, so you can easily check the execution of your transactions, in real time. The Starknet Remix Plugin is integrated with Starknet By Example, a rich repository of practical learning content.

Starknet’s account type is inspired by Ethereum’s EIP-4337, where instead of EOAs, you now use smart contract accounts with arbitrary verification logic. Through the use of smart contracts, you are provided with complete flexibility within your account implementation. While not mandatory at the protocol level, a richer standard interface for accounts was developed by the community. This standard was developed by OpenZeppelin, in a close collaboration with wallet teams and other Core Starknet developers. You can see the traits as defined in SNIP-6 (Starknet Improvement Proposal #6). In Starknet, similar to Ethereum, every contract has a nonce. This nonce is sequential; when a transaction is sent from an account, its nonce must match the account’s nonce and it’s incremented after the transaction is executed (whether or not it was reverted). In Starknet, only the nonce of account contracts, that is, those adhering to the above structure, can be non-zero. In contrast, in Ethereum, regular smart contracts, known as Contract Accounts, as opposed to Externally Owned Accounts can increment their nonce by deploying smart contracts, that is, executing the CREATE and CREATE2 opcodes. For more information on accounts in Ethereum, see Ethereum Accounts in the Ethereum documentation. A nonce serves two important roles: It guarantees transaction hash uniqueness (this is important for good UX) It provides replay protection to the account (since the signature refers to a particular nonce, the transaction can’t be replayed by a malicious party) As seen above, Starknet currently determines the nonce structure (sequential) at the protocol level. In the future, Starknet will consider a more flexible design, extending account abstraction to nonce management (previously referred to as \"nonce abstraction\").","title":"Starknet account interface","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"approach","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Accounts/approach/","titles":[{"text":"Replay protection","hash":"replay_protection","id":1}]},"23":{"id":23,"text":"Starknet provides the deploy_account transaction in order to deploy new accounts to the network. In order to deploy a new account on StarkNet you need to complete the following steps: Decide on the account contract that you want to deploy Compute your would-be account address off-chain Send funds to this address Once the address has enough funds to pay for the deployment, you can then send a deploy_account transaction. Upon receiving a deploy_account transaction, the sequencer will: Verify that the address has funds to pay for the deployment Execute the constructor with the given arguments Execute the __validate_deploy__ entry point (See below) Charge fee from the new account address Advance the nonce to 1 There are two potential issues that arise from sending a deploy_account transaction without any extra validation: Sequencers having the ability to charge arbitrarily high fees, thus potentially draining user funds from a pre-funded account A bad actor having the ability to carry out a sequencer DOS attack by sending multiple, invalid deploy_account transactions. This would result in the sequencer not being compensated for work completed. To prevent the scenario described in the first point, a new optional validation entrypoint is provided: __validate_deploy__. To prevent the potential DOS attack from the second point, we introduce some limitations on the constructor and _validate_deploy _ executions, namely: Limited # of Cairo steps Limited # of builtin applications No external contract calls (library calls and self-calls are allowed) This entrypoint should be included in any accounts or contracts that wish to allow this new deployment flow. __validate_deploy__ expects the following arguments: class hash contract address salt constructor arguments - the arguments expected by the contract’s constructor (this will be enforced in the compiler). In determining the contract address, deployer address 0 will be used. Consider an account with the following constructor signature: @constructor func constructor{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}( _public_key: felt ) Then the signature of __validate_deploy__ must be: func __validate_deploy__{ syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr, ecdsa_ptr: SignatureBuiltin* }(class_hash: felt, contract_address_salt: felt, _public_key: felt) The transaction hash and max_fee are accessible through the get_tx_info system call.","title":"Deploying new accounts","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"deploying_new_accounts","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Accounts/deploying_new_accounts/","titles":[{"text":"Deploy account transaction","hash":"deploy_account_transaction","id":1},{"text":"Transaction flow","hash":"transaction_flow","id":2},{"text":"Validate deploy","hash":"validate_deploy","id":3},{"text":"Using validate deploy","hash":"using_validate_deploy","id":4}]},"24":{"id":24,"text":"An account represents a user onchain, and enables that user to interact with the blockchain. Through an account, you can send transactions and interact with other contracts. In order for you to own an onchain asset, such as an ERC-20 token or an NFT, that asset must be associated with your account address. Within Ethereum individual user accounts are known as Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). EOAs differ from smart contracts in that EOAs are not controlled by code, but rather by a pair of private and public keys. The account’s address is derived from those keys and only by possessing the private key can you initiate transactions from an account. While Ethereum contracts are passive, that is, they can only change if they were called inside a transaction, EOAs can initiate transactions. While simple, because the signature scheme is fixed, EOAs have some drawbacks, including the following: Control over the private key gives complete control over the account, so you must keep your seed phrase secure yet accessible. Limited flexibility surrounding wallet functionality EIP-4337 is a design proposal for Ethereum that outlines account abstraction, whereby all accounts are managed via a dedicated smart contract on the Ethereum network, as a way to increase flexibility and usability. You can add custom logic on top of the basic EOA functionality, thereby bringing account abstraction into Ethereum. Account abstraction enables more flexible account management. Rather than the protocol determining an account’s behavior, an account contract, which is a smart contract with programmable logic, defines a user’s account. Using account abstraction you can now program how your account functions. For example, you can: Determine what it means for a signature to be valid, or what contracts your account is allowed to interact with. This is known as signature abstraction. Pay transaction fees in different tokens. This is known as fee abstraction. Design your own replay protection mechanism and allow sending multiple uncoupled transactions in parallel. In Ethereum, you cannot send two transactions in parallel, you must wait for confirmation of the first before sending the second. Otherwise, the second transaction can be rejected due to an invalid nonce. With account abstraction, a sequential nonce is not required. This is known as nonce abstraction. Today, Starknet offers signature abstraction. In the future, we will enrich the current account abstraction design. For example, see the paymaster proposal for fee abstraction in the Starknet Community Forum. Two examples of how you might program an account to function using account abstraction are: Social recovery A process where if you lose your wallet, you are able to retrieve it via a selected social network, vastly improving the typical experience of wallet recovery. Operating your account via facial recognition With signature abstraction, you can use your phone’s native hardware to sign transactions, making it practically impossible to take control of another user’s account, even if your phone is stolen.","title":"What is an account?","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"introduction","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Accounts/introduction/","titles":[{"text":"Ethereum account structure","hash":"ethereum_account_structure","id":1},{"text":"What is Account Abstraction?","hash":"account_abstraction","id":2},{"text":"Examples of customizing account functionality","hash":"examples","id":3}]},"25":{"id":25,"text":"The key stages of transaction lifetime are: The sequencer selects a transaction from the mempool and executes __validate__ If the transaction was valid, the __execute__ function is called If __execute__ ran successfully, the sequencer includes the transaction in the block, charges the fee and proceeds to work on the next transaction (once the block is concluded, it will be sent to the prover) The sequencer receives fees in ETH in return for including transactions in a block.

The __validate__ function ensures that any transaction submitted was indeed initiated by the account owner and therefore will not take up unjustified resources during the execution process. Without this mechanism, a forged transaction can result in the sequencer stealing the user’s funds. In short, __validate__ ensures that the sequencer may only include transactions that were approved by the account owner. The arbitrary logic allowed in the __validate__ function gives the account’s designer the ability to determine what it means for a transaction to be valid. This gives rise to the usage of different signature schemes and other exotic accounts. When the __validate__ function fails, no fee will be taken from the account in question. There are some limitations set on the __validate__ function. The purpose of these limitations is twofold: We want to avoid the sequencer having to do a lot of work only to discover that the validation failed and the sequencer is then not eligible to charge a fee (if this was possible, the sequencer would be completely exposed to DOS attacks). Validation, while now abstract and in control of the account owner rather than the protocol, should still be a simple operation. This is why in the future, Starknet will place max steps limitation upon the __validate__ function. Even if the validation is simple, we could still face the following attack: An attacker fills the mempool with transactions that are valid at time T. A sequencer may start executing them, thinking that at the time he will produce his block, they will still be valid. However, shortly after, at time T', the attacker sends one transaction that somehow invalidates all the previous ones and makes sure it’s included before the sequencer gets to publish his block (the attacker may do this by offering higher fees for this one transaction). As a concrete example, think of many __validate__ functions checking that the value of a storage slot is 1 and the attacker’s transaction later sets it to 0. To handle this issue, we add some further limitations. Currently, Starknet enforces that __validate__ does not call external contracts. The property that we achieve with the above restrictions is that a single storage update may only invalidate transactions from a single account (this is the best we can do, an account can always invalidate its own past transactions by changing its keys). Thus, the price (in fees) required to invalidate transactions in the mempool is linear in the number of unique accounts that we want to invalidate. The purpose of the __execute__ function is to abstract away the remaining actions performed by a transaction. In Ethereum, a transaction is necessarily a call to a specific function in a smart contract. With the __execute__ abstraction, the account designer controls the flow of the transaction. For example, multicalls can be natively supported in your account, saving the need to send multiple transactions (in practice, this is even harder to manage without multicalls due to nonces). A transaction is considered reverted when the __execute__ function failed. A reverted transaction is included in a block and the sequencer is eligible to charge a fee for the work done up to the point of failure, similar to Ethereum.","title":"Validate and execute","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"validate_and_execute","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Accounts/validate_and_execute/","titles":[{"text":"The validate function","hash":"the_validate_function","id":1},{"text":"Invalid transactions","hash":"invalid_transactions","id":2},{"text":"Validate limitations","hash":"validate_limitations","id":3},{"text":"The execute function","hash":"the_execute_function","id":4},{"text":"Reverted transactions","hash":"reverted_transactions","id":5}]},"27":{"id":27,"text":"All hashes outputs are eventually mapped to elements in \\(\\mathbb{F}_p\\) with \\(p=2^{251}+17\\cdot 2^{192}+1\\).

If you want to skip the motivation and deep dive into the mechanism, you can skip directly to the final formula. This section focuses on fees paid by an account on L2. For information about messaging fees that are paid on L1, see L1 → L2 message fees. Users can specify the maximum fee that they are willing to pay for a transaction via the max_fee field. The only limitation on the sequencer (enforced by the Starknet OS) is that the actual fee charged is bounded by max_fee, but for now, StarkWare’s sequencer will only charge the fee required to cover the proof cost (potentially less than the max fee). Presently, the sequencer only takes into account L1 costs involving proof submission. There are two components affecting the L1 footprint of a transaction: Computational complexity: the heavier the transaction, the larger its portion in the proof verification cost. Onchain data: L1 calldata cost originating from data availability and L2→L1 messages. The fee is denominated in ETH (this may change in future versions). Each transaction is associated with a gas estimate (explained below), and combining this with the gas price yields the estimated fee. Let’s analyze the correct metric for measuring transaction complexity. For simplicity, we will ignore Cairo’s builtins for the sake of the explanation, and later see how to address them. Recall that a Cairo program execution yields an execution trace. When proving a Starknet block, we aggregate all the transactions appearing in that block to the execution trace. Starknet’s prover generates proofs for execution traces, up to some maximal length \\(L\\) (Derived from the specs of the proving machine and the desired proof latency). Tracking the execution trace length associated with each transaction is simple. Each assertion over field elements (such as verifying addition/multiplication over the field) requires the same, constant number of trace cells (this is where our “no-builtins” assumption kicks in! Obviously Pedersen occupies more trace cells than addition). Therefore, in a world without builtins, the fee of the transaction \\(tx\\) is correlated with \\(\\text{TraceCells}[tx]/L\\). The Cairo execution trace is separated — and each builtin has its own slot. We have to mind this slot allocation when determining the fee. Let’s go over a concrete example first. For example, imagine the following trace that the prover will occupy: (up to) 500,000,000 Cairo Steps (up to) 20,000,000 Pedersen hashes (up to) 4,000,000 signature verifications (up to) 10,000,000 range checks The proof is closed and sent to L1 when any of these components becomes full. Suppose, for example, that a transaction uses 10,000 Cairo steps and 500 Pedersen hashes. We can squeeze at most 40,000 such transactions into our hypothetical trace (20,000,000/500). Therefore, its gas price will be correlated with 1/40,000 of the cost of submitting proof. Notice we completely ignored the number of Cairo steps in this transaction performance estimation, as it is not the limiting factor (since 500,000,000/10,000 > 20,000,000/500). With this example in mind, we can now formulate the exact fee associated with L2 computation. The allocation of resources among built-in operations must be predetermined; it’s not possible to decide post-execution to include only 20,000,001 Pedersen hashes without additional components. This safeguards fairness and prevents manipulation, ensuring integrity in proof generation and fee determination. For each transaction, the sequencer calculates a vector CairoResourceUsage holding: Number of Cairo steps Number of applications of each Cairo builtin (e.g., five range checks and two Pedersen hashes) The sequencer crosses this information with the CairoResourceFeeWeights vector. For each resource type (step or a specific builtin application), CairoResourceFeeWeights has an entry that specifies the relative gas cost of that component in the proof. Going back to the above example, if the cost of submitting a proof with 20,000,000 Pedersen hashes is roughly 5m gas, then the weight of the Pedersen builtin is 0.25 gas per application (5,000,000/20,000,000). The sequencer has a pre-defined weights vector, in accordance with the proof parameters. The sequencer will charge only according to the limiting factor! Therefore the fee is correlated with: \\[\\max_k[\\text{CairoResourceUsage}_k \\cdot \\text{CairoResourceFeeWeights}_k]\\] Where \\(k\\) here enumerates the Cairo resource components, i.e. the number of steps and builtins used. The weights are: Step Gas cost Cairo step 0.01 gas/step Pedersen 0.32 gas/application Poseidon 0.32 gas/application Range check 0.16 gas/application ECDSA 20.48 gas/application Keccak 20.48 gas/application Bitwise 0.64 gas/application EC_OP 10.24 gas/application The onchain data associated with a transaction is composed of three parts Storage updates L2→L1 messages Deployed contracts Whenever a transaction updates a key at the storage of some contract, the following data reaches L1: Contract_address Number of updated keys in that contract Key to update New value Note that only the most recent value reaches L1. That is, the transaction’s fee only depends on the number of unique storage updates (if the same storage cell is updated multiple times within the transaction, the fee remains that of a single update). Consequently, the associated storage update fee for a transaction updating \\(n\\) unique contracts and \\(m\\) unique keys is: \\[\\text{gas_price}\\cdot c_w\\cdot\\underbrace{(2n+2m)}_{\\text{number of words}}\\] where \\(c_w\\) is the calldata cost (in gas) per 32-byte word. Note that there are many possible improvements to the above pessimistic estimation that will be gradually presented in future versions of Starknet. For example, if different transactions within the same block update the same storage cell, there is no need to charge both of them (only the latest value reaches L1). In the future, Starknet may include a refund mechanism for such cases. When a transaction that raises the send_message_to_l1 syscall is included in a state update, the following data reaches L1: L2 sender address L1 destination address Payload size Payload (list of field elements) Consequently, the fee associated with a single L2→L1 message is: \\[\\text{gas_price}\\cdot c_w\\cdot(3+\\text{payload_size})\\] where \\(c_w\\) is the calldata cost (in gas) per 32-byte word. When a transaction that raises the deploy syscall is included in a state update, the following data reaches L1: Contract address Class hash Consequently, the fee associated with a single deployment is: \\[\\text{gas_price}\\cdot 2 c_w\\] where \\(c_w\\) is the calldata cost (in gas) per 32-byte word. The fee for a transaction with: Cairo usage represented by the vector \\(v\\) (the entries of \\(v\\) correspond to the number of steps and number of applications per builtin) \\(n\\) unique contract updates \\(m\\) unique key updates \\(t\\) messages with payload sizes \\(q_1,...,q_t\\) \\(\\ell\\) contract deployments is given by: \\[F = \\text{gas_price}\\cdot\\left(\\max_k v_k w_k + c_w\\left(2(n+m) + 3t + \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^t q_i + 2\\ell\\right)\\right)\\] where \\(w\\) is the weights vector discussed above and \\(c_w\\) is the calldata cost (in gas) per 32-byte word. The fee is charged atomically with the transaction execution on L2. The Starknet OS injects a transfer of the fee-related ERC-20, with an amount equal to the fee paid, the sender equal to the transaction submitter, and the sequencer as a receiver.","title":"Gas and transaction fees","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"fee-mechanism","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Network_Architecture/fee-mechanism/","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"introduction","id":1},{"text":"Fee units","hash":"fee_units","id":2},{"text":"How much fee is charged?

During the execution of a Starknet transaction, a contract on Starknet sends an L2→L1 message by calling the send_message_to_L1 syscall. The message parameters (which contain the recipient contract on L1 and the relevant data) are then attached to the relevant state update that includes this syscall invocation. For example: let mut payload: Array = ArrayTrait::new(); let to_address: EthAddress = 1_felt252.try_into().unwrap(); payload.append(1); // potentially add more elements to payload (payload[1], payload[2], etc.) send_message_to_l1_syscall(to_address: to_address.into(), payload: payload.span()); After the state update that included this transaction is proved and the L1 state is updated, the message is stored on L1 in the Starknet Core Contract (and the relevant counter is increased), and the LogMessageToL1 event (which contains the message parameters) is emitted. Later, the recipient address on L1 can access and consume the message as part of an L1 transaction by re-supplying the message parameters. This is done by calling consumeMessageFromL2 in the Starknet Core Contract, who verifies that the hash corresponds to a stored message and that the caller is indeed the recipient on L1. In such a case, the reference count of the message hash in the Starknet Core Contract decreases by 1. The above flow is illustrated in the following diagram: As demonstrated above, the structure of an L2 → L1 message is given by: Table 1. L2 → L1 Message FromAddress ToAddress Payload FieldElement EthereumAddress Payload The hash of an L2 → L1 message is computed on L1 as follows: keccak256( abi.encodePacked( FromAddress, uint256(ToAddress), Payload.length, Payload ) ); As the hash of the message being sent needs to be written to L1 storage (in the Starknet Core contract) there is always a fixed 20k gas cost associated with sending an L2 to L1 message. Contracts on L1 can interact asynchronously with contracts on L2 via the L1→L2 messaging protocol. The protocol consists of the following stages: An L1 contract initiates a message to an L2 contract on Starknet. It does so by calling the sendMessageToL2 function on the Starknet Core Contract with the message parameters. The Starknet Core Contract hashes the message parameters and updates the L1→L2 message mapping to indicate that a message with this hash was indeed sent. In fact, the L1 contract records the fee that the sender paid. For more information, see L1 → L2 message fees. The message is then decoded into a Starknet transaction that invokes a function annotated with the l1_handler decorator on the target contract. Transactions like this on L2 are called L1 handler transactions. The Starknet sequencer, upon seeing enough L1 confirmations for the transaction that sent the message, initiates the corresponding L2 transaction. The L2 transaction invokes the relevant l1_handler. The L1 Handler transaction that was created in the previous step is added to a proof. The state update is received on the Core contract. the message is cleared from the Core contract’s storage. At this point, the message is handled. An L1→L2 message consists of: The L1 sender address The recipient contract address on Starknet Function selector Calldata array Message nonce Message nonce The message nonce is maintained on the Starknet Core contract on L1, and is bumped whenever a message is sent to L2. It is used to avoid hash collisions between different L1 handler transactions that are induced by the same message being sent on L1 multiple times (see below). Imagine a scenario where a user transfers an asset from L1 to L2. The flow starts with the user sending the asset to a Starknet bridge and the corresponding L1→L2 message generation. Now, imagine that the L2 message consumption doesn’t function (this might happen due to a bug in the dApp’s Cairo contract). This could result in the user losing custody over their asset forever. To mitigate this risk, we allow the contract that initiated the L1→L2 message to cancel it after declaring the intent and waiting a suitable amount of time. The user starts by calling startL1ToL2MessageCancellation with the relevant message parameters in the Starknet Core Contract. Then, after a five days delay, the user can finalize the cancellation by calling cancelL1ToL2Message. The reason for the delay is to protect the sequencer from a DOS attack in the form of repeatedly sending and canceling a message before it is included in L1, rendering the L2 block which contains the activation of the corresponding L1 handler invalid. Note that this flow should only be used in edge cases such as bugs on the Layer 2 contract preventing message consumption. An L1 → L2 message induces a transaction on L2, which, unlike regular transactions, is not sent by an account. This calls for a different mechanism for paying the transaction’s fee, for otherwise the sequencer has no incentive of including L1 handler transactions inside a block. To avoid having to interact with both L1 and L2 when sending a message, L1 → L2 messages are payable on L1, by sending ETH with the call to the payable function sendMessageToL2 on the Starknet Core contract. The sequencer takes this fee in exchange for handling the message. The sequencer charges the fee in full upon updating the L1 state with the consumption of this message. The fee itself is calculated in the same manner as \"regular\" L2 transactions. You can use the CLI to get an estimate of an L1 → L2 message fee. For completeness, we describe the precise structure of both the message as it appears on L1 and the induced transaction as it appears on L2. Table 2.

A transaction \\(tx\\) transitions the system from state \\(S\\) to state \\(S'\\) if: \\(tx\\) is an invoke transaction, and the storage of \\(S'\\) is the result of executing the target contract code with respect to the previous state \\(S\\) (the arguments, contract address, and the specific entry point are part of the transaction) \\(tx\\) is a deploy_account transaction, and \\(S'\\) contains the new contract’s state at the contract’s address. Additionally, the storage of \\(S\\) is updated according to the execution of the contract’s constructor. \\(tx\\) is a declare transaction, and \\(S'\\) contains the class hash and definition in the contract classes mapping The state commitment is a digest which uniquely (up to hash collisions) encodes the state. In Starknet, the commitment combines the roots of two binary Merkle-Patricia trees of height 251 in the following manner: state_commitment = ℎ( \"STARKNET_STATE_V0\", contracts_tree_root, classes_tree_root ) Where: \\(h\\) is the Poseidon hash function STARKNET_STATE_V0 is a constant prefix string encoded in ASCII (and represented as a field element). contracts_tree_root is the root of the Merkle-Patricia tree whose leaves are the contracts states, see below classes_tree_root is the root of the Merkle-Patricia tree whose leaves are the compiled class hashes, see below Like Ethereum, this is a 2-level structure where the contract address determines the path from the root to the leaf encoding the contract state. The information stored in the leaf is: \\[h(h(h(\\text{class_hash}, \\text{storage_root}), \\text{nonce}),0)\\] Where: \\(h\\) is the Pedersen hash function. \\(\\text{class_hash}\\) is the hash of the contract’s definition discussed here \\(\\text{storage_root}\\) is the root of another Merkle-Patricia tree of height 251 that is constructed from the contract’s storage \\(\\text{nonce}\\) is the current nonce of the contract The classes tree encodes the information about the existing classes in the state of Starknet.

However, the prover only deals with Cairo assembly. This means that unless we want the compilation from Sierra to Casm to be part of every block in which the class is used, the commitment must have some information about the associated Cairo assembly. Today, the user signs the compiled_class_hash as part of a declare v2 transaction. If the transaction was included in a block, then this compiled_class_hash becomes part of the commitment. In the future, when Sierra→Casm compilation becomes part of the Starknet OS, this value may be updated via a proof of the Sierra→Casm compiler execution, showing that compiling the same class with a newer compiler version results in some new compiled class hash. As mentioned above, our commitment scheme uses a binary Merkle-Patricia tree with the Pedersen hash function. Each node in the tree is represented by a triplet \\((length, path, bottom)\\). The actual data is placed in the leaves, and a leaf node with data \\(x\\) is encoded by the triplet \\((0,0,x)\\). Empty nodes (leaves or internal) are encoded by the zero triplet \\((0,0,0)\\). A subtree rooted at a node \\((length, path, bottom)\\) has a single non-empty subtree, rooted at the node obtained by following the path specified by \\(path\\). \\(path\\) is an integer in \\([0, 2^{length}-1]\\), and the binary expansion of \\(path\\) indicates how should we proceed along the tree, where the first step is indicated by the most significant bit, and \\(0,1\\) are interpreted as left, right correspondingly. The reason that length is specified and cannot be deduced from \\(path\\) is that we’re dealing with field elements of fixed size (251 bits each). For a node with \\(length>0\\), following \\(path\\) leads the highest node whose both right and left child are none empty. The following rules specify how the tree is constructed from a given set of leaves: The hash of a node \\(N =(length, path, bottom)\\), denoted by \\(H(N)\\), is: \\[H(N)=\\begin{cases} bottom, & \\text{if } length = 0 \\\\ h(bottom, path) + length, & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\\] Note that any arithmetic operations in the above are done in our field. We can now proceed to recursively define the nodes in the tree. The triplet represents the parent of the nodes \\(left=(\\ell_L, p_L, b_L)\\), \\(right=(\\ell_R, p_R, b_R)\\) is given by: \\[parent= \\begin{cases} (0,0,0), & \\text{if } left=right=(0,0,0)\\\\ (\\ell_L + 1, p_L, b_L), & \\text{if } right=(0,0,0) \\text{ and } left \\neq (0,0,0)\\\\ (\\ell_R + 1, p_R + 2^{\\ell_R}, b_R), & \\text{if } right\\neq (0,0,0) \\text{ and } left = (0,0,0)\\\\ (0, 0, h(H(left), H(right))), & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\\] We now show an example of the construction of a height 3 Merkle-Patricia tree from the leaves \\([0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]\\): Where \\(r=h(H(2,2,1),H((2,1,1))\\). Note that in our example there is no skipping from the root (length is zero), so the final commitment to the tree will be \\(H((0,0,r))=r\\). Suppose that we want to prove, with respect to the commitment we have just computed, that the value of the leaf whose path is given by \\(101\\) is \\(1\\). In a standard Merkle tree, the proof would have consisted of data from three nodes (siblings along the path to the root). Here, since the tree is sparse, we only need to send the two children of the root \\((2,2,1), (2,1,1)\\). This suffices to reproduce the commitment \\(r\\), and since the height of the tree, \\(3\\), is known and fixed, we know that the path \\(01\\) of length \\(2\\) specified by the right child \\((2,1,1)\\) leads us to the desired leaf. Starknet uses special contract addresses to provide distinct capabilities beyond regular contract deployment. Two such addresses are 0x0 and 0x1. These addresses are reserved for specific purposes and are characterized by their unique behavior in comparison to traditional contract addresses. Address 0x0 functions as the default caller_address for external calls, including interactions with the L1Handler or deprecated Deploy transactions. Unlike regular contracts, address 0x0 does not possess a storage structure and does not accommodate storage mapping. Address 0x1 is another special contract address within Starknet’s architecture. It functions as a storage space for mapping block numbers to their corresponding block hashes. The storage structure at this address is organized as follows: Keys Block numbers between the first_v0_12_0_block and the current block minus 10. Values Corresponding block hashes for the specified blocks. Default Values For all other block numbers, the values are set to 0. The storage organization of address 0x1 supports the efficient retrieval of block hashes based on block numbers within a defined range and is also used by the get_block_hash system call.","title":"Starknet state","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"starknet-state","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Network_Architecture/starknet-state/","titles":[{"text":"State commitment","hash":"state_commitment","id":1},{"text":"The contracts tree","hash":"contracts_tree","id":2},{"text":"The classes tree","hash":"classes_tree","id":3},{"text":"Merkle-Patricia tree","hash":"merkle_patricia_tree","id":4},{"text":"Specifications","hash":"specifications","id":5},{"text":"Example trie","hash":"example_trie","id":6},{"text":"Special addresses","hash":"special_addresses","id":7},{"text":"0x0 address","hash":"0x0_address","id":8},{"text":"0x1 address","hash":"0x1_address","id":9}]},"35":{"id":35,"text":"StarkGate is the Ethereum↔Starknet token bridge developed by StarkWare. Each supported token is associated with an L1 and L2 bridge contract that communicates via Starknet’s messaging mechanism. To use StarkGate, go to https://starkgate.starknet.io. A bridge enables you to fund your L2 wallet with ETH and ERC-20 tokens that reside on L1. For simplicity, we use terms such as deposit, transact, and transfer to refer to various operations involving a bridge, even though ETH and ERC-20 tokens never actually leave Ethereum. In order to reduce the risks involved in using an Alpha version, StarkGate Alpha on Mainnet has limitations regarding the deposit amount and total value locked in the L1 bridge contract: Token Max total value locked ETH 150,000 ETH WBTC 200 WBTC USDC 40,000,000 USDC USDT 20,000,000 USDT DAI 5,000,000 DAI rETH 10,000 rETH wstETH 5,000 wstETH We plan to gradually ease these limitations and lift them completely, as confidence grows. Changes will be updated here. The user calls the function deposit (see ERC-20 deposit and ETH deposit), supplying as parameters the recipient address on Starknet and the amount to transfer in the case of ERC-20 token. The deposit function then: Checks that the funds transferred are within the Alpha limitations Transfers the funds from the user account to the Starknet bridge Emits a deposit event with the sender address on L1, the recipient address on L2, and the amount Sends a message to the relevant L2 bridge with the amount to be transferred, and the recipient address as parameters. Note that, since every single bridge is dedicated to one token type, the token type doesn’t have to be explicit here. At the end of this step (i.e., after the execution on L1) the deposit transaction is known to Starknet’s sequencer, yet sequencers may wait for enough L1 confirmations before the corresponding deposit transaction is initiated on L2. During this step, the status of the L2 deposit transaction is NOT_RECEIVED. Once enough block confirmations are received for step 1, the sequencers may refer to the deposit request by triggering the L1 handler using the handle_deposit function on the L2 bridge. The function handle_deposit verifies that the deposit indeed came from the corresponding L1 bridge. It then calls to the relevant ERC-20 contract (e.g. the ERC-20 representing ETH on Starknet) and mints the tokens for the user. At the end of this step (i.e., after the sequencer processed this transaction, but before a proof is generated), the status of the deposit request will be ACCEPTED_ON_L2. Once the sequencer completes the block construction, Starknet’s provers will prove its validity and submit a state update to L1. When this happens, the message confirming the funds transfer will be cleared from the Starknet Core Contract, and the fact that the user has transferred their funds will be part of the now finalized state of Starknet. Note that if the message wasn’t on L1 to begin with (meaning Starknet “invented” a deposit request), the state update would fail. To initiate a withdraw, a user calls the initiate_withdraw function on the L2 bridge contract, supplying as parameters the recipient address on Ethereum, as well as the amount to transfer. The withdraw function then: Burns the transferred amount of tokens from the balance of the withdrawal’s initiator Sends a message to the relevant L1 bridge with the amount to be transferred, and the recipient address as parameters. As before, since the bridges are token-specific, the token itself is implicit here. Once the sequencer completes the block construction, Starknet’s provers will prove the validity of the block and submit a state update to L1. When this happens, the message from the previous step is stored in the Starknet Core Contract. After the withdraw message has been recorded on the Starknet Core Contract, anyone can finalize the transfer on L1 from the bridge back to the user, by calling the withdraw function (see ERC-20 withdraw and ETH withdraw). This step is permissionless, and may be performed by anyone. Since the user’s address is part of the recorded message on L1, he will be the recipient of the funds, regardless of who called the withdraw function on L1.","title":"StarkGate bridge","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"token-bridge","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Network_Architecture/token-bridge/","titles":[{"text":"StarkGate overview","hash":"starkgate_overview","id":1},{"text":"StarkGate Alpha limitations","hash":"starkgate_alpha_limitations","id":2},{"text":"L1→L2 transfer (deposit)","hash":"l1l2_transfer_deposit","id":3},{"text":"Step 1: Call the deposit function on L1","hash":"step_1_call_the_deposit_function_on_l1","id":4},{"text":"Step 2: deposit triggered on Starknet","hash":"step_2_deposit_triggered_on_starknet","id":5},{"text":"Step 3: The block that includes the transfer is proved","hash":"step_3_the_block_that_includes_the_transfer_is_proved","id":6},{"text":"L2→L1 transfer (withdraw)","hash":"l2l1_transfer_withdraw","id":7},{"text":"Step 1: Call the withdraw function on L2","hash":"step_1_call_the_withdraw_function_on_l2","id":8},{"text":"Step 2: The block that includes the transaction is proved","hash":"step_2_the_block_that_includes_the_transaction_is_proved","id":9},{"text":"Step 3: Transferring the funds on L1","hash":"step_3_transferring_the_funds_on_l1","id":10}]},"36":{"id":36,"text":"The transaction lifecycle in Starknet involves the following high level steps: A transaction is submitted to one of the gateways, functioning as the Mempool and marks the transaction status as RECEIVED. The Mempool performs validation on the transaction to check for its validity. If the transaction is invalid, it will not proceed to the next stages. The sequencer performs validation on the transaction prior to execution to ensure that the transaction is still valid. If the transaction is invalid, it will not proceed to the next stages. The sequencer operation sequentially applies the validated transactions to the state. If a transaction fails during execution, it will be included in the block with the status REVERTED. The Prover stage executes the operating system on the new block, computes the proof, and transmits it to L1. The diagram below illustrates how each transaction status fits into the overall transaction flow: The following are the possible statuses of a transaction from the moment it’s sent by the user to the moment it’s validated by L1: The transaction is not yet known to the sequencer. The transaction was received by the mempool. The transaction will now either execute successfully, be rejected or be reverted. The transaction passed validation and entered an actual created block on L2. The transaction was accepted on Ethereum. The transaction was received by the Mempool but failed validation in the sequencer. Such transactions will not be included in a block. The transaction passed validation but failed during execution in the sequencer. They will be included in the block with the status REVERTED. The transaction was successfully executed by the sequencer. When a transaction is marked as REVERTED, the following state implications occur: Nonce increases The nonce value for the account of the failed transaction will increase despite the failure. Fee charge A fee will be charged for the execution of the transaction up to the point of failure. Partial Reversion All changes that occurred during the validate stage are not reverted. However, all changes that occurred during the execute stage are reverted, including no messages to L1 or events. Fee Calculation The fee charged for REVERTED transactions will be calculated as follows: fee = Min(max_fee, consumed_resources) Consumed Resources The consumed_resources are the resources used for the execution of the transaction up to the point of failure. This includes Cairo steps, builtins, syscalls, L1 messages, events, and state diffs during the validate and execute stages. The transaction receipt contains: Basic transaction details (block identifiers and the index within the block). A summary of the execution resources used by the transaction. The events emitted . A list of messages sent to L1. A consumed L1 message (in case the transaction invokes an L1 handler).

When the fields that comprise a transaction change, either with the addition of a new field or the removal of an existing field, then the transaction version increases. Do not submit a transaction that uses an unsupported transaction type, because it cannot be included in a proof, and so cannot become part of a Starknet block. In order to calculate the transaction hash, we first need to obtain the deployed contract address. The Deploy transaction’s hash is calculated as follows: deploy_tx_hash = ℎ( \"deploy\", version, contract_address, sn_keccak(\"constructor\"), ℎ(constructor_calldata), 0, chain_id ) Where: The placeholder zero is used to align the hash computation for the different types of transactions. “deploy” and “constructor” are constant strings encoded in ASCII. \\(h\\) is the Pedersen hash and \\(sn\\_keccak\\) is Starknet Keccak. chain_id is a constant value that specifies the network to which this transaction is sent.

Next, the user would submit the compilation output (the contract class) to the Starknet sequencer via a declare transaction. With Cairo 1.0, the contract class resulting from compiling Cairo 1.0 does not include Casm. Instead of Casm, it includes instructions in an intermediate representation called Sierra (Safe Intermediate Representation). This new contract class is then compiled by the sequencer, via the Sierra → Casm compiler, to generate the Cairo assembly associated with this class. The Casm code is then executed by the Starknet OS. Starknet is a validity rollup, which means that the execution inside every block needs to be proven, and this is where STARKs come in handy. However, STARK proofs can address statements that are formulated in the language of polynomial constraints, and have no knowledge of smart contract execution. To overcome this gap, we developed Cairo. Cairo instructions (which we referred to previously by Casm) are translated to polynomial constraints that enforce the correct execution of a program (according to the Cairo semantics defined in the paper). Thanks to Cairo, we can formulate the statement \"this Starknet block is valid\" in a way that we can prove. Note that we can only prove things about Casm. That is, regardless of what the user sends to the Starknet sequencer, what’s proven is the correct Casm execution. This means that we need a way to translate Sierra into Casm, and this is achieved with the Sierra → Casm compiler. To understand why we chose to add an additional layer between the code that the user writes (Cairo 1.0) and the code that is being proven (Casm), we need to consider more components in the system, and the limitations of Cairo. A crucial property of every decentralized L2 is that the sequencers are guaranteed to be compensated for work they do. The notion of reverted transactions is a good example: even if the user’s transaction failed mid execution, the sequencer should be able to include it in a block and charge execution fees up to the point of failure. If the sequencer cannot charge for such transactions, then sending transactions that will eventually fail (after a lot of computation steps) is an obvious DOS attack on the sequencer. The sequencer cannot look at a transaction and conclude that it would fail without actually doing the work (this is equivalent to solving the halting problem). The obvious solution to the above predicament is to include such transactions in the block, similar to Ethereum. However, this may not be as simple to do in a validity rollup. With Cairo 0, there is no separating layer between user code and what is being proven. This means that users can write code which is unprovable in some cases. In fact, such code is very easy to write, e.g. assert 0=1 is a valid Cairo instruction that cannot be proven, as it translates to polynomial constraints that are not satisfiable. Any Casm execution that contains this instruction cannot be proven. Sierra is the layer between user code and the provable statement, that allows us to make sure all transactions are eventually provable. The method by which Sierra guarantees that user code is always provable is by compiling Sierra instructions to a subset of Casm, which we call \"safe Casm\". The important property that we require from safe Casm is being provable for all inputs. A canonical example for safe Casm is using if/else instructions instead of assert, that is, making sure all failures are graceful. To better understand the considerations that go into designing the Sierra → Casm compiler, consider the find_element function from the common library of Cairo 0: func find_element{range_check_ptr}(array_ptr: felt*, elm_size, n_elms, key) -> (elm_ptr: felt*) { alloc_locals; local index; %{ ... %} assert_nn_le(a=index, b=n_elms - 1); tempvar elm_ptr = array_ptr + elm_size * index; assert [elm_ptr] = key; return (elm_ptr=elm_ptr); } Below we abuse the \"Casm\" notation by not distinguishing Cairo 0 from Casm and referring to the above as Casm (while we actually refer to the compilation result of the above). For brevity, we have omitted the hint in the above snippet, but it’s clear that this function can only execute correctly if the requested element exists in the array (otherwise it would fail for every possible hint - there is nothing we can substitute index for, that makes the following lines run successfully). Such Casm cannot be generated by the Sierra→Casm compiler. Furthermore, simply replacing the assertion with an if/else statement doesn’t do, as this results in non-deterministic execution. That is, for the same input, different hint values can yield different results. A malicious prover can use this freedom to harm the user - in this example, they are able to make it seem as if an element isn’t part of the array, even though it actually is. The safe Casm for finding an element in an array behaves like the above snippet in the happy flow (element is there): an index is given in a hint, and we verify that the array at the hinted index contains the requested element. However, in the unhappy flow (element isn’t there), we must go over the entire array to verify this. This was not the case in Cairo 0, as we were fine with certain paths not being provable (in the above snippet, the unhappy flow in which the element isn’t in the array is never provable). Sierra’s gas metering adds further complications to the above example. Even looking through the array to verify that the element isn’t there may leave some flexibility to the prover. If we take gas limitations into consideration, the user may have enough gas for the happy flow, but not for the unhappy one, making the execution stop mid-search, and allowing the prover to get away with lying about the element not being present. The way we plan to handle this is by requiring the user to have enough gas for the unhappy flow before actually calling find_element. Smart contracts written with Cairo 1.0 cannot contain user defined hints. This is already true with Cairo 0 contracts (only whitelisted hints are accepted), but with Cairo 1.0 the hints in use are determined by the Sierra → Casm compiler. Since this compilation is there to ensure that only \"safe\" Casm is generated, there is no room for hints that are not generated by the compiler. In the future, native Cairo 1.0 may contain hint syntax similar to Cairo 0, but it will not be available in Starknet smart contracts (L3s on top of Starknet may make use of such functionality). Note that this is currently not part of Starknet’s roadmap.","title":"Cairo and Sierra","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"cairo-and-sierra","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Smart_Contracts/cairo-and-sierra/","titles":[{"text":"Why do we need Casm?","hash":"why_do_we_need_casm","id":1},{"text":"Why do we need Sierra?","hash":"why_do_we_need_sierra","id":2},{"text":"Reverted transactions, unsatisfiable AIRs, and DOS attacks","hash":"reverted_transactions_unsatisfiable_airs_and_dos_attacks","id":3},{"text":"Safe Casm","hash":"safe_casm","id":4},{"text":"Hints in Cairo 1.0","hash":"hints_in_cairo_1_0","id":5}]},"39":{"id":39,"text":"The class hash is a hash chain of the definition of the class.

\"new_syntax_test_contract::new_syntax_test_contract::counter_contract::CounterDecreased\", \"kind\": \"nested\" } ] } ] With Cairo v2.3.0 the limitations on the Event enum have been relaxed, allowing more flexibility on the events that can be emitted from a given contract. For example: It is no longer enforced that the Event enum variants are structs of the same name as the variant, they can now be a struct or an enum of any name. Enum variants inside event ABI entries (entries in the abi with \"type\": \"event\" and \"kind\": \"enum\") now have two possible kinds. Before v2.3.0 it was always \"kind\": \"nested\", now \"kind: \"flat\" is also possible. v2.3.0 is backwards compatible with version ≥ 2.0.0 ABI, so the same structure of the ABI is kept, while allowing flexibility. Between versions v2.0.0 and v2.2.0, to identify all potential serializations of events (what raw keys, data arrays can be emitted given the ABI), it was sufficient to iterate over the abi entries with \"type\": \"event\" and \"kind\": \"struct\", skipping the encapsulating Event type which has \"kind\": \"enum\". With v2.3.0 onwards, doing so may result in losing information. To illustrate this, consider the following example: // high level code defining the events #[event] #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] enum Event { ComponentEvent: test_component::Event, TestCounterIncreased: CounterIncreased, TestCounterDecreased: CounterDecreased, TestEnum: MyEnum } #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] struct CounterIncreased { amount: u128 } #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] struct CounterDecreased { amount: u128 } #[derive(Copy, Drop, starknet::Event)] enum MyEnum { Var1: MyStruct } #[derive(Copy, Drop, Serde, starknet::Event)] struct MyStruct { member: u128 } In v2.3.0 enum variant types can now have any name. As an example the TestCounterIncreased variant and the CounterIncreased type, as they appear in the ABI: { \"type\": \"event\", \"name\": \"::Event\", \"kind\": \"enum\", \"variants\": [ { \"name\": \"ComponentEvent\", \"type\": \"::test_component::Event\", \"kind\": \"nested\" }, { \"name\": \"TestCounterIncreased\", \"type\": \"::CounterIncreased\", \"kind\": \"nested\" }, { \"name\": \"TestCounterDecreased\", \"type\": \"::CounterDecreased\", \"kind\": \"nested\" }, { \"name\": \"TestEnum\", \"type\": \"::MyEnum\", \"kind\": \"nested\" } ] }, { \"type\": \"event\", \"name\": \"::CounterIncreased\", \"kind\": \"struct\", \"members\": [ { \"name\": \"amount\", \"type\": \"core::integer::u128\", \"kind\": \"data\" } ] } When the contract emits the TestCounterIncreased event, for example by writing self.emit(CounterIncreased { amount })), the event that is emitted has the following keys and data: One key based on the variant name: sn_keccak(TestCounterIncreased). This information only appears in the ::Event type entry in the ABI, as the name TestCounterIncreased does not appear in the \"kind\": \"struct\" ABI entry. This did not matter in previous versions when the variant name and type had to be equal. One data element based on the struct CounterIncreased which is associated to TestCounterIncreased via one of the Event type variants. The introduction of components allows variants of Event to be enums. In the following example, we have two such variants: TestEnum (unrelated to components) and ComponentEvent. The serialization to keys and data is the same in both cases, so this example will focus on TestEnum: This example shows the TestEnum variant entry inside Event: { \"name\": \"TestEnum\", \"type\": \"::MyEnum\", \"kind\": \"nested\" } This example shows the MyEnum event entry: { \"type\": \"event\", \"name\": \"::MyEnum\", \"kind\": \"enum\", \"variants\": [ { \"name\": \"Var1\", \"type\": \"::MyStruct\", \"kind\": \"nested\" } ] } This example shows the MyStruct event entry: { \"type\": \"event\", \"name\": \"::MyStruct\", \"kind\": \"struct\", \"members\": [ { \"name\": \"member\", \"type\": \"core::integer::u128\", \"kind\": \"data\" } ] } If a TestEnum event is being emitted via self.emit(Event::TestEnum(MyEnum::Var1(MyStruct {member: 5}))), you can implement the trait Into to avoid having to write it out in full. When the event is emitted, the serialization to keys and data happens as follows: Since the TestEnum variant has kind nested, add the first key: sn_keccak(TestEnum), and the rest of the serialization to keys and data is done recursively via the starknet::event trait implementation of MyEnum. Next, you can handle a \"kind\": \"nested\" variant (previously it was TestEnum, now it’s Var1), which means you can add another key depending on the sub variant: sn_keccak(Var1), and proceed to serialize according to the starknet::event implementation of MyStruct. Finally, proceed to serialize MyStruct, which gives us a single data member. This results in keys = [sn_keccak(TestEnum), sn_keccak(Var1)] and data=[5] Allowing variants which are themselves enums (TestEnum is an enum variant here) means further nesting is possible. For example, if the high level code is changed to: #[event] #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] enum Event { ComponentEvent: test_component::Event, TestCounterIncreased: CounterIncreased, TestCounterDecreased: CounterDecreased, TestEnum: MyEnum } #[derive(Copy, Drop, starknet::Event)] enum MyEnum { Var1: AnotherEnum } #[derive(Copy, Drop, Serde, starknet::Event)] enum AnotherEnum { Var2: MyStruct } #[derive(Copy, Drop, Serde, starknet::Event)] struct MyStruct { member: u128, } then self.emit(Event::TestEnum(MyEnum::Var1(AnotherEnum::Var2(MyStruct { member: 5 })))) (as before, Into implementations can shorten this) will emit an event with keys = [sn_keccak(TestEnum), sn_keccak(Var1), sn_keccak(Var2)] and data=[5]. This will look as follows in the ABI (only the relevant parts are shown): { \"type\": \"event\", \"name\": \"::Event\", \"kind\": \"enum\", \"variants\": [ // ignoring all the other variants for berevity { \"name\": \"TestEnum\", \"type\": \"::MyEnum\", \"kind\": \"nested\" } ] }, { \"type\": \"event\", \"name\": \"::MyEnum\", \"kind\": \"enum\", \"variants\": [ { \"name\": \"Var1\", \"type\": \"::AnotherEnum\", \"kind\": \"nested\" } ] }, { \"type\": \"event\", \"name\": \"::AnotherEnum\", \"kind\": \"enum\", \"variants\": [ { \"name\": \"Var2\", \"type\": \"::MyStruct\", \"kind\": \"nested\" } ] } As TestEnum, Var1 and Var2 are of kind nested, a selector should be added to the list of keys, before continuing to recursively serialize. You may not want to nest enums when serializing the event. For example, if you write an ERC20 as a component (not a contract) which is pluggable anywhere, you may not want the contract to modify the keys of known events such as Transfer. To avoid nesting, write the following high level code: #[event] #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] enum Event { ComponentEvent: test_component::Event, TestCounterIncreased: CounterIncreased, TestCounterDecreased: CounterDecreased, #[flat] TestEnum: MyEnum } By writing the above, the TestEnum variant entry in the ABI will change to: { \"name\": \"TestEnum\", \"type\": \"::MyEnum\", \"kind\": \"flat\" } This means that self.emit(Event::TestEnum(MyEnum::Var1(MyStruct {member: 5}))) will emit an event with keys=[sn_keccak(Var1)] and data=[5]. With the transition to v2.0.0, the contract ABI underwent some changes. Consider the following high level code that generates the ABI in the following example: #[starknet::interface] trait IOtherContract { fn decrease_allowed(self: @TContractState) -> bool; } #[starknet::interface] trait ICounterContract { fn increase_counter(ref self: TContractState, amount: u128); fn decrease_counter(ref self: TContractState, amount: u128); fn get_counter(self: @TContractState) -> u128; } #[starknet::contract] mod counter_contract { use starknet::ContractAddress; use super::{ IOtherContractDispatcher, IOtherContractDispatcherTrait, IOtherContractLibraryDispatcher }; #[storage] struct Storage { counter: u128, other_contract: IOtherContractDispatcher } #[event] #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] enum Event { CounterIncreased: CounterIncreased, CounterDecreased: CounterDecreased } #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] struct CounterIncreased { amount: u128 } #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] struct CounterDecreased { amount: u128 } #[constructor] fn constructor( ref self: ContractState, initial_counter: u128, other_contract_addr: ContractAddress ) { self.counter.write(initial_counter); self .other_contract .write(IOtherContractDispatcher { contract_address: other_contract_addr }); } #[external(v0)] impl CounterContract of super::ICounterContract { fn get_counter(self: @ContractState) -> u128 { self.counter.read() } fn increase_counter(ref self: ContractState, amount: u128) { let current = self.counter.read(); self.counter.write(current + amount); self.emit(CounterIncreased { amount }); } fn decrease_counter(ref self: ContractState, amount: u128) { let allowed = self.other_contract.read().decrease_allowed(); if allowed { let current = self.counter.read(); self.counter.write(current - amount); self.emit(CounterDecreased { amount }); } } } } Since the CounterContract impl is annotated with the #[external(v0)] attribute, you’ll find the following impl entry in the ABI: { \"type\": \"impl\", \"name\": \"CounterContract\", \"interface_name\": \"new_syntax_test_contract::new_syntax_test_contract::ICounterContract\" } This means that every function appearing in the ICounterContract interface is a possible entry point of the contract. Standalone functions in the contract outside an external impl can also be annotated with #[external(v0)] (currently, this is the only way to add L1 handlers). In such cases, a corresponding function (or l1_handler) entry will be found in the ABI in the same hierarchy as impls and interfaces. In Cairo v2, a dedicated type for the contract’s events was introduced. Currently, the contract event type must be an enum named Event, whose variants are structs of the same name as the variant. Types that can be emitted via self.emit(_) must implement the Event trait, which defines how this type should be serialized into two felt252 arrays, keys and data. The Event enum variants appear in the ABI under \"type\" = \"event\" rather than regular structs. For such entries, each member has an additional kind field which specifies how the serialization into keys and data takes place: If the kind is key, then this member or variant are serialized into the event’s keys. If the kind is data, then this member or variant are serialized into the event’s data. If the kind is nested, then the member or variant are serialized according to the Event attribute, potentially adding to both keys and data. This feature is not yet supported, so no high level code written in Cairo v2.0.0 can generate such an ABI. You can find a JSON schema specification of the ABI in the starknet-specs repository. For a UI-friendly version, you can use the OPEN-RPC playground.","title":"Contract ABI","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"contract-abi","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Smart_Contracts/contract-abi/","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"introduction","id":1},{"text":"An example contract ABI","hash":"an_example_contract_abi","id":2},{"text":"Cairo v2.3.0 changes","hash":"cairo_v2_3_0_changes","id":3},{"text":"Nested events","hash":"nested_events","id":4},{"text":"Variant names different from types","hash":"variant_names_different_from_types","id":5},{"text":"Enum variants inside Event","hash":"enum_variants_inside_event","id":6},{"text":"Flattened enum variants","hash":"flattened_enum_variants","id":7},{"text":"Cairo v2.0.0 changes","hash":"cairo_v2_0_0_changes","id":8},{"text":"Interface and Impl ABI entries","hash":"interface_and_impl_abi_entries","id":9},{"text":"Events","hash":"events","id":10},{"text":"Specification","hash":"specification","id":11}]},"41":{"id":41,"text":"The contract address is a unique identifier of the contract on Starknet.

The storage is a map with \\(2^{251}\\) slots, where each slot is a felt which is initialized to 0. The basic function for writing to storage writes, value to key is: storage_write_syscall(address_domain, address, value) storage_read is a basic function that is used for getting the storage address, this function is created by the compiler when defining a storage variable, as explained below. This function returns the address of the storage variable. Below we discuss how this address is determined from the variable’s name and keys. Both storage_read and storage_write are system calls that can be imported by adding the line: use starknet::syscalls::storage_read_syscall; use starknet::syscalls::storage_write_syscall; The most common way for interacting with a contract’s storage is through storage variables. The @storage_var decorator declares a variable that will be kept as part of the contract storage. The variable can consist of a single felt, or it can be a mapping from multiple arguments to a tuple of felts or structs. To use this variable, the var.read(args), var.write(args, value) and var.addr(args) functions are automatically created by the @storage_var decorator, for reading the storage value, writing the storage value and getting the storage address, respectively. The Starknet contract compiler generates the Cairo code that maps the storage variable’s name and argument values to an address — so that it can be part of the generated proof. The address of a storage variable is computed as follows: If it is a single value, then the address is sn_keccak(variable_name), where variable_name is the ASCII encoding of the variable’s name. If it is a (nested) mapping, then the address of the value at key k_1,...,k_n is h(...h(h(sn_keccak(variable_name),k_1),k_2),...,k_n) where \\(h\\) is the Pedersen hash and the final value is taken \\(\\bmod 2^{251}-256\\) If it is a mapping to complex values (e.g., tuples or structs), then this complex value lies in a continuous segment starting from the address calculated in the previous point. Note that 256 field elements is the current limitation on the maximal size of a complex storage value. Note that when calling var.addr(args) for a storage variable with complex values, the returned value is the address of the first element in the storage. We can summarize the above as follows: storage variable address := pedersen(keccak(variable name), keys) In the following example we define a storage variables with complex values. struct Storage { name: felt252, symbol: felt252, decimals: u8, total_supply: u256, balances: LegacyMap::, allowances: LegacyMap::, }","title":"Contract storage","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"contract-storage","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Smart_Contracts/contract-storage/","titles":[{"text":"Storage layout","hash":"storage_layout","id":1},{"text":"Storage low level functions","hash":"storage_low_level_functions","id":2},{"text":"Storage variables","hash":"storage_variables","id":3}]},"44":{"id":44,"text":"With the v2.0.0 release of the Cairo compiler, the Starknet contract syntax has evolved, affecting the organization of functions, storage, and events.

For example: old new struct Storage { counter: u128, other_contract: IOtherContractDispatcher } #[storage] struct Storage { counter: u128, other_contract: IOtherContractDispatcher } Gather your contract’s external and view function signatures under a trait annotated with #[starknet::interface] as follows: Add a generic parameter to the trait. In the following example, the name TContractState represents the state of your contract. For view functions, add the self: @TContractState argument. For external functions, add the ref self: TContractState argument. Static functions that do not touch storage or emit events do not require an additional argument. For example: old new #[contract] mod CounterContract { #[external] fn increase_counter(amount: u128) { ... } #[external] fn decrease_counter(amount: u128) { ... } #[view] fn get_counter() -> u128 { ... } } #[starknet::interface] trait ICounterContract { fn increase_counter(ref self: TContractState, amount: u128); fn decrease_counter(ref self: TContractState, amount: u128); fn get_counter(self: @TContractState) -> u128; } #[starknet::contract] mod CounterContract { ... } Add the external and view function bodies under an impl of the interface trait, and mark the impl with the [external(v0)] attribute, which generates the type of dispatcher that is used to call the contract. For example: old new #[contract] mod CounterContract { #[external] fn increase_counter(amount: u128) { ... } #[external] fn decrease_counter(amount: u128) { ... } #[view] fn get_counter() -> u128 { ... } } #[starknet::interface] trait ICounterContract { fn increase_counter(ref self: TContractState, amount: u128); fn decrease_counter(ref self: TContractState, amount: u128); fn get_counter(self: @TContractState) -> u128; } #[starknet::contract] mod CounterContract { #[external(v0)] impl CounterContract of super::ICounterContract { fn increase_counter(ref self: ContractState, amount: u128) { ... } fn decrease_counter(ref self: ContractState, amount: u128) { ... } fn get_counter(self: @ContractState) -> u128 { ... } } } Replace the #[abi] attribute with #[starknet::interface]. While it doesn’t affect the generated code, adding to the trait a generic parameter T representing the contract’s state, and adding the ref self: T argument to external functions and self: @T argument for view functions makes the implementation more complete. For example: old new #[abi] trait IOtherContract { fn decrease_allowed() -> bool; } #[starknet::interface] trait IOtherContract { fn decrease_allowed(self: @TContractState) -> bool; } Modify storage accesses to happen through ContractState or @ContractState. No external functions in the contract that access storage also need to get it as an argument. For example: old new let current = counter::read(); let current = self.counter.read(); Unify all the contract’s events under the Event enum, and add a corresponding struct for every variant. All the structs must derive the Event trait, and each member type must implement the Serde trait. For example: old new #[event] fn counter_increased(amount: u128) {} #[event] fn counter_decreased(amount: u128) {} #[event] #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] enum Event { CounterIncreased: CounterIncreased, CounterDecreased: CounterDecreased } #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] struct CounterIncreased { amount: u128 } #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] struct CounterDecreased { amount: u128 } Emit events via the ContractState type. For example: old new fn increase_counter(amount: u128) { ... counter_increased(amount); } fn increase_counter(ref self: ContractState, amount: u128) { ... self.emit(Event::CounterIncreased(CounterIncreased { amount })); }","title":"Migrating a contract from Cairo 0 to Cairo","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"contract-syntax","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Smart_Contracts/contract-syntax/","titles":[]},"45":{"id":45,"text":"A contract may emit events throughout its execution. Each event contains the following fields: from_address: address of the contract emitting the events keys: a list of field elements data: a list of field elements The keys can be used for indexing the events, while the data may contain any information that we wish to log (note that we are dealing with two separate lists of possibly varying size, rather than a list of key-value pairs). Events can be defined in a contract using the @event decorator. Once an event E has been defined, the compiler automatically adds the function E.emit(). The following example illustrates how an event is defined and emitted: #[event] fn Transfer(from: ContractAddress, to: ContractAddress, value: u256) {} Transfer(12345, 12345, 1) The emit function emits an event with a single key, which is an identifier of the event, given by \\(\\text{sn_keccak(event_name)}\\), where \\(\\text{event_name}\\) is the ASCII encoding of the event’s name and \\(\\text{sn_keccak}\\) is defined here. To emit custom keys, one should use the low level emit_event system call: use starknet::syscalls::emit_event_syscall; let keys = ArrayTrait::new(); keys.append('key'); keys.append('deposit'); let values = ArrayTrait::new(); values.append(1); values.append(2); values.append(3); emit_event_syscall(keys, values).unwrap_syscall(); The above code emits an event with two keys, the strings \"status\" and \"deposit\" (think of those as identifiers of the event that can be used for indexing) and three data elements 1, 2, 3. When using the higher level emit syntax, the event’s data may be of complex types, for example: struct Point: member x : felt member y : felt end @event func message_received(arr_len : felt, arr: felt*, p: Point): end # ... let (data : felt*) = alloc() assert data[0] = 1 assert data[1] = 2 let p = Point(3,4) message_received.emit(2, data, p) The emitted events are part of the transaction receipt. The event definition appears in the contract’s ABI. It contains the list of data fields (name and type) and the list of the custom keys (that is, all keys except the event identifier discussed above). Below is an example of an event inside the ABI: { \"type\": \"event\", \"name\": \"Transfer\", \"inputs\": [ { \"name\": \"from\", \"type\": \"core::starknet::contract_address::ContractAddress\" }, { \"name\": \"to\", \"type\": \"core::starknet::contract_address::ContractAddress\" }, { \"name\": \"value\", \"type\": \"core::integer::u256\" } ] } The event hash is given by: \\[h(h(h(h(0,\\text{from_address}),\\text{keys_hash}),\\text{data_hash}),3)\\] Where: \\(\\text{keys_hash}\\), \\(\\text{data_hash}\\) are the hashes of the keys list and data list correspondingly (see array hashing). \\(h\\) is the Pedersen hash function. The event hashes are included in the event_commitment field of a block.","title":"Events","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"starknet-events","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Smart_Contracts/starknet-events/","titles":[{"text":"Emitting events","hash":"emitting_events","id":1},{"text":"Event ABI","hash":"event_abi","id":2},{"text":"Event hash","hash":"event_hash","id":3}]},"46":{"id":46,"text":"Writing smart contracts requires various associated operations, such as calling another contract or accessing the contract’s storage, that standalone programs do not require.
